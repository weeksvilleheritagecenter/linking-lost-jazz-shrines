‡ Willard Jenkins: One of the reasons for this conversation is to review the list of Lost Jazz Shrines of Brooklyn that we have developed as a result of our oral history interviews.  There are some places that are more known than others.  When I interviewed ‡ Ed Stoute he mentioned several places that others had not detailed.  So I want to bring up the names of some of these places to get further details.  For example, where was the ‡ Town & Country?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: It was on Flatbush Avenue across from King’s Plaza, near Avenue U.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Where was the ‡ Crescent Lounge?


(No one seems to recall the Crescent Lounge.)


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Willoughby Temple?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: ‡ The Universal Temple it was also called, its still there on Willoughby Avenue at the corner of Nostrand Avenue.  It’s a Masonic Temple.  I saw ‡ Miles Davis play there, the stage was tiny.   


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Happy Landing?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jimmy Morton: You’re coming up with some weird names!


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Berry Brothers?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jimmy Morton: That was on Fulton Street.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: Right across from Boys & Girls High is.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Who played there?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: Some of everybody….


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Was that a place that employed strictly Brooklyn musicians, or musicians from elsewhere?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jimmy Morton: The place was in Brooklyn but the musicians came from everywhere.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: And that’s the thing about Brooklyn places, even right now.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ The Carroll Bar?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: Fulton Street between Verona Place and Nostrand Avenue; it was a little joint and I used to hear ‡ Lucky Emmett, a sax player and a piano player named ‡ James Sykes.  They used to play tunes in any key.  What they used to do was invite musicians up to jam and they’d call any tune, like “Cherokee”, and they’d start it off and when the musician would get up to take his solo and it would be in D.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: ‡ Bird[a][b][c] [[unknown if Larry or Gary]] used to do that too.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Club 243?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That was on Flatbush Avenue just before you got to Myrtle Avenue, upstairs over a car dealership.  Metrotech bought all of that [property] out.  They had a lot of Brooklyn people play there, a lot of people from everywhere.  ‡ Joe Knight played there.  We had this little bass player named ‡ Eddie Hamilton… I played there.  There were never any venues where only Brooklyn musicians played everything was all intermingled.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about ‡ The Monaco?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That was over on Utica Avenue.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: That was a bar on Utica Avenue near Pacific Street that wasn’t known much for music.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: Its still there but its been closed down for years, they had music there every now and then.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: During the Just Us days there was a place on Eastern Avenue near Utica, a great big room that was downstairs…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: I remember that one, but I can’t remember the name.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jimmy Morton: ‡ The Id was on Utica Avenue, you’d go downstairs…  The Just Us ladies, a bunch of wives, used to support the music.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: ‡ The Id was on East New York Avenue near San Gabriel Street, it’s a church now.  That was a beautiful place.  ‡ Clifford Jordan, ‡ Sam Jones, ‡ Cedar Walton, ‡ Billy Higgins, all the cats used to play there.  The place on Eastern Parkway you’re talking about was the ‡ Wishco Manor.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What did they present there?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: It was mainly a dancehall it wasn’t a nightclub.  You could rent the place and present whatever you wanted to.  That was on Eastern Parkway and Utica Avenue.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: We have a number of articles we have from the Amsterdam News Brooklyn edition.  Was it the ‡ Verona Café or ‡ Café Verona?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: I don’t know, but it was a little bar on Fulton Street.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: Right, that’s where I heard ‡ Don Byas and ‡ Leonard Hawkins.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: I was walking down the street one day and I heard this piano coming from outta there, I never knew they had a piano in that place.  I walked in there and there was ‡ Gil Coggins!


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: What was this place ‡ Farmer John’s?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: I don’t remember.  The ‡ Verona Café was on Fulton Street right across from Verona Place.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: Do you have the ‡ K & C Lounge?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Yeah, at Gates & Throop.  What happened there?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: It was an organ place.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: Small groups, I used to play there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Moulin Rouge?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: It was on Sumner and Putnam.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What happened there?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: I saw ‡ Miles Davis there with ‡ Red Garland, all kind of people played in there.  It had a long bar and the bandstand was in back of the bar.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: Maybe you should classify these places as A-B-C….


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: That’s kind of where we are, because obviously the A places are like the ‡ Blue Coronet, ‡ The East, ‡ The Muse, ‡ Putnam Central, ‡ Tony’s, ‡ The Baby Grand Brooklyn, ‡ The Continental and ‡ The Kingston Lounge.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: What about the ‡ 78 Club?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: Yeah, that was at 78 Herkimer.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That is a church now.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: That was owned by a brother named Scottie.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Who used to play there?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: Everybody…  I remember one night when ‡ Charlie Parker was supposed to play there and ‡ Max [[Max Roach]], ‡ Freddie Braithwaite [[Freddie Braithwaite, Sr.]] and all the guys were waiting, and this guy ‡ Teddy Reig brought ‡  Charlie over there [drunk] and they wanted to throw [Reig] down the stairs [laughs].  It was a very important club, owned by a brother named Scottie.  It was a very nice place.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Grecian Cave.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: I think that was on Franklin Avenue; I’ve heard of it but I don’t think too much music went on in there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: Do you have ‡ Brownie’s?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Yes, on Bergen Street.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: No, on St. Marks between Nostrand and New York.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: They sold the place and then everybody started going over to ‡ The Continental.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: This place pre-dated ‡ The Continental?  What about the ‡ Tip Top Inn?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: Fulton Street.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Would you call that an A or B place?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: C [laughs].


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: What was the club on Halsey Street where ‡ Freddie Hubbard was all the time?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: That was the ‡ Turbo Village.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ Turbo Village was at Halsey and Reed Streets.  We’re in agreement that those places like ‡ The Blue Coronet, ‡ The Muse, ‡ The East, ‡ Putnam Central, ‡ Tony’s [[Tony’s Grand Dean]], ‡ The Baby Grand [[Baby Grand Brooklyn]], ‡ The Continental, ‡ The Kingston Lounge, and ‡ The 78 Club were A-level places?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: Do you have the black theaters as well?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: I’ve got the ‡ Sonya Ballroom…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: ‡ The Brooklyn Apollo, ‡ The Art…  Guys used to play there…  ‡ The Brooklyn Apollo was on Fulton, the‡  Art Theater was on Marcy and Fulton…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jimmy Morton: That’s a church now.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: I played there once with my mom & pop; they had an upright piano for a theater and all the gangs met there.  All of a sudden bottles started flying in the air, no big deal, that was normal [laughs], I had to get my folks outta there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: ‡ The Breevoort Theater used to have music.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: I have that one.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: I remember them places well.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Arlington Inn, is that on the A list?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That was ‡ King Curtis’ hangout…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: That’s a C…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Tip Top Inn?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: That’s a C.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That was at Utica and Fulton.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston:  I remember they had an organ-violin duo with a guy named ‡ Richard Otto on violin.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: They had shows there; this sister named ‡ Tony Lester used to sing there.  They were trying to be like the ‡ Baby Grand [[Baby Grand Brooklyn?]].  When I played at the ‡ Baby Grand  they had three shows a night: a comic MC, a shake dancer, and the band.  You’d have either a rock or blues singer, and a jazz singer.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Flamingo Lounge?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: I’d say that was on the B list.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: You had a lot of social clubs that would have us play for dances at the ‡ Sonya Ballroom, ‡ The Elks Club on Fulton Street…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: There was another one out there by Beverly Road and Bedford, it was  a supper club that leaned towards jazz.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That place was fancy, but he never did much business out there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: It never had a big rep; I’d put that as a C- [laughs]


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Pretty soon we’re gonna start a D list.  What about ‡ Town Hill?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: The same people that owned both Baby Grands (Brooklyn and Manhattan) [‡ Baby Grand [[ Baby Grand Harlem]] // ‡ Baby Grand [[Baby Grand Manhattan]]]  owned ‡ Town Hill.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: Don’t forget ‡ Pumpkins…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That was the 80s and 90s.  When I first started playing there he had big crowds, but for some reason if you rubbed him the wrong way he ran you outta there.  He ran himself out of business.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: I think he just gave up.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: What was this place on Gates and Nostrand, where you took the elevator to get there?  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That was a dancehall but I don’t remember the name of it.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: I worked there with a band and we were supposed to get 75cents and the promoter cut out with the money.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: Wait a minute, what was this guy that used to cut out with the money all the time?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: ‡ Cecil [[Cecil Boldon]] [laughs], he was famous for that…  Luckily we all lived with mom & pop.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: ‡ Cecil Bolden…  Cats would be on the bandstand playing and he’d be gone.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: We’re laughing now, but we weren’t laughing then!


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: Duke and his brother had a rep for that; they would hire you but you’d have to sit around the club for hours after you finished waiting to get paid.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Jazz Spot?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That was very recent – at Marcus Garvey and Kosciusko Street.  That wasn’t as big as this room.  They tried hard; it was nice and clean, it was a sister and her daughter.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Somebody told me the reason that place didn’t make it was because it was located in an area that people didn’t go.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: Location…  The projects were right there on DeKalb Avenue…  They didn’t sell any liquor.  They’d clean that place completely before they opened back up again, but it was so tiny a lot of people felt claustrophobic up there.  They never really did any good business.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Town & Country?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: I played one gig in there but I never really knew much about it.  I played for a singer there; it was a huge place.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: How about the ‡ Crescent Lounge?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: I know the name, but I don’t remember it.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the  ‡ Willoughby Temple?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That was at Willoughby and Nostrand, its more like a dancehall.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Where exactly was the ‡ Club La Marchal?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: ‡ La Marchal [[Club La Marchal]] was at President and Nostrand.  That’s actually where “The Night of the Cookers” [Blue Note record] was recorded.  They’d hire you, I took bands in there, people played in there, it was a weekend kind of thing.  I’d say that was maybe a B-list, because of “The Night of the Cookers.”


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: Do you have the ‡ Brooklyn Palace?  It was on Atlantic Avenue, a place for dance; there were two places, ‡  Sonya Ballroom and the ‡ Brooklyn Palace.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That was on Atlantic Avenue and St. Marks.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about a place called ‡ Ben’s on Lexington and Sumner Avenue?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: It was a bar and one of the gigs I got there was with ‡ Harold Cumberbatch; they had a raggedy piano, there were so many keys missing…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about ‡ Paul’s?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: It was at DeKalb and Sumner Avenue.  It was a bar too, but they had little shows in there; that was a nice place, ‡ Paul’s.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: How about  ‡ The Breevoort Theater?


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Ed Stoute: That was at Breevoort Place and Bedford Avenue; that’s a welfare center now.  But they had a lot of music in there, ‡ Miles Davis played there with the group with ‡ Cannonball Adderley, ‡ John Coltrane…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jimmy Morton: …They did rock & roll shows in there, I saw ‡ Otis Redding there too.  I went in there hiding [laughs], a jazz buff seeing ‡ Otis Redding!


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about ‡ The Fantasy?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: ‡ The Fantasy was on Utica Avenue; they actually had some top-shelf entertainment, I just can’t remember names off-hand.  Remember ‡ Burt Keyes, piano player-composer, he used to play in there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: Yeah, I remember ‡ Burt Keys…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: A lot of top-shelf groups played there, and people came from all over; they used to have limousines double-parked out front.  But then they had that first riot in the 60s, and that killed the entertainment in ‡ Brooklyn…  ‡ The Baby Grand [[Baby Grand Brooklyn]] went dead… white people wouldn’t come to ‡ Brooklyn anymore.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Sam Pinn: And stick-up men used to come into some of those places too, taking people’s money, their shoes, making people undress.  This was in the 70s…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: That killed a lot.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: I remember the Black musicians club on Schenectady, upstairs.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Was that the black union?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: Exactly, all the older musicians used to go there and the younger guys would come.  I have no history of that club, but this was before Local 802 – it was the black union.  That was very important for us, we’d meet all the older guys.  We used to go up there and the big bands would have days off and they would come in there and play cards.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: Randy, what about the Chess Club, the 212 Club?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: That was on Gates Avenue and Classon.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: It was an old mansion-like house.  They had a piano in there, but I don’t think they had live music.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: ‡ Max [[Max Roach]] and all of them would come in and play chess.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: ‡ Maurice Brown told me about that place…  It was cool.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about ‡ Smuckers at Schermerhorn and Flatbush?


~BLOCKBREAK~


All: Never heard of it…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: …And that’s probably why, it was downtown [laughs].  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ The Tiffany Lounge?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: It was a bar at Nostrand Avenue and Bergen, right in the middle of the block.  I had forgotten all about that one.  She was doing music pretty regularly in there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jennifer Scott:  What were your favorite places to play?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Reggie Workman: When you say you don’t remember ‡ Smuckers, that name rings a bell for me because I came along much later, being from Philly.  I came along when ‡ Gigi Gryce was at ‡ the Continental, and places like that.  So those clubs like ‡ La Marchal [[Club La Marchal]] and ‡ Smuchers [[Smuckers]] came along at that time.  That was when the group of musicians’ wives, the Just Us ladies were getting involved in a lot of stuff, and of course my wife was involved.  When I came in it was with ‡ Freddie Cole, much later than the actual stuff was happening.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: I was going to a lot of places when I was 18-19 years old.  We were going any place where they had music.  A bunch of us were working at Rubin H. Donnelley at the time and it was very convenient because they laid you off in the spring and you didn’t get back until September.  So we just collected out unemployment checks and lived with mother & father, and we were going everywhere there was music.  We went everywhere we were the crazy kids. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: A number of people we interviewed talked about how the audiences reacted at ‡ the East, ‡ Jazz 966, ‡ Sista’s Place, and how it spurs that creativity.  A lot of folks felt there was a difference in how the audiences reacted in ‡ Brooklyn versus how they reacted in Manhattan clubs, particularly those in downtown Manhattan.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jimmy Morton: ‡ Etta Jones told me that she loved ‡ Jazz 966 because everybody there knew all of her lyrics, any song she did everybody would be singing along.  She liked the fact that they knew her, knew her music.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: You talk about places to play… Wynton Kelly’s uncle at the church on Stuyvesant Avenue, we’d go there on New Year’s Eve and ‡ Wynton [[Wynton Kelly]] would play the organ.  We’d go there and ‡ Wynton [[Wynton Kelly]] would play the organ, then at midnight we’d go and party.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jimmy Morton: Yeah, Wynton’s uncle was ‡ Cannon Miller, and it was Cannon Miller’s church.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: A lot of the musicians rehearsed and played in the homes, and that’s not necessarily documented. Do you have ‡ Irvin Burgie’s name?  He wrote all of ‡ Harry Belafonte’s hits, we grew up together. He was right out on Albany Avenue. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: Did I tell you about ‡ The Hole?  It was on Bridge Street and Willoughby Avenue.  You could go to ‡ The Hole after hours, jam sessions,  walk down Bridge Street from Fulton Street when you got to the end of the block there was a subway stairs; you go down one flight and there was a door to the right and there was ‡ The Hole; jam sessions all night long.  I remember me and my brother going down there on Saturday night and we didn’t leave until Sunday night.  All kinds of musicians used to come through there – ‡ Jaki Byard came through there, ‡ Gil Coggins used to hang out, everybody…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: What was the place they called  ‡ The Bucket of Blood?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: They called a lot of places that!  [Laughs]  What was happening at a lot of these places where a lot of music took place, say ‡ The Flamingo, a lot of guys came through there but the owner of the club I couldn’t understand how they would do it; you could sit at the bar and you could smell the men’s room and they would never fix it.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: That was like ‡ The Five Spot!


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: ‡ The Moulin Rouge you’d be standing in the back and water used to run across the floor.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Randy Weston: Is that where ‡ Scoby Strohman used to play?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Ed Stoute: Scoby used to play there, I played there, ‡ Tommy Williams used to play there.


[a]Unsure who this refers to. We have Gary Bird and Larry Bird as the two persons with "Bird" in their name thus far.
[b]Hmm... I'm not sure which one it might be. Just leave this comment open and I'll try to figure it out when I do the reviews.
[c]sounds good!

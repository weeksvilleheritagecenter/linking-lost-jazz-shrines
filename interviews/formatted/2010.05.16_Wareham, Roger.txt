‡ Willard Jenkins: In the whole development of your efforts through the December 12 movement, what have been your activities in the area of arts and culture? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: Politically one of our slogans or mantras is that "culture is a weapon." For every struggle for liberation one of the most important components, if not the most important component, is culture. And that takes many forms. I always remember a lecture that Amilcar Cabral, who led the liberation struggle in Guinea-Bissau gave in the Cape Verde islands; he started off the discussion talking about Goebbels, and how whenever the Nazis had a discussion and the issue of culture came up, Goebbels took out his gun and put it on the table because he was really clear that if you were going to suppress a people, to conquer them you had to destroy their culture. So we always saw culture as a key component for our struggle for liberation. So the theme of ‡ Sista's Place is "culture is a weapon." 


We opened up on September 23, 1995 on ‡ John Coltrane's birthday; we start our season around then and we've always had artists who reflect some degree of consciousness of the nature of our struggle. So we've never separated the art from the culture. It's been mainly music, but we also have poetry — ‡ Luis Reyes Rivera conducts poetry workshops and we've had different people putting on plays. But we've never separated and we don't want those who enjoy the culture to separate culture from the history and the struggle that created it, it's a part of it and it also feeds and energizes it.

‡ Willard Jenkins: The perishable goods you sell to the community, how do you see the availability of those goods and what you present on your stages as being compatible? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: One is spiritual and politically educational sustenance, and the other is physical sustenance. So we don't see a real separation because people have to eat, people have to be healthy. We try to provide things that are healthy for people. So in addition to the provision of fruits and vegetables, there's health drinks, seminars, we've run different campaigns in the community around asthma, we've had seminars on how is it that the treatment of health should not be reactive but should be preventive, and what steps people need to take. There's always been that at ‡ Sista's Place. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: From the time that you came to ‡ Brooklyn to live, what was your experience with jazz music? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: I'm from Harlem [laughs]... People from New York City will know, when you say you're from Harlem you don't deal with ‡ Brooklyn; ‡ Brooklyn was like you needed a passport to come to ‡ Brooklyn back in the day. My experience in ‡ Brooklyn was extremely vicarious. There were artists whose music I liked who performed in ‡ Brooklyn that I didn't know how they were connected to ‡ Brooklyn, I listened to ‡ Randy [[Randy Weston]], listened to ‡ Freddie Hubbard, but I never thought of them as ‡ Brooklyn artists, they were just jazz artists that I liked. So when we came here… our first music director was ‡ Carlos Garnett, and certainly with [current Sista's Place music director] ‡ Ahmed [[Ahmed Abdullah]], I became aware about the places, and when the musicians started coming in and talking about the older places, like the ‡ Blue Coronet and the different spots where people used to play [in ‡ Brooklyn], I became much more aware of the history [of jazz in ‡ Brooklyn]. 


I don't know it chapter and verse, but I understand the richness of ‡ Brooklyn's contribution to jazz and maybe more so than Harlem because a lot of folks who played there weren't indigenous to Harlem, whereas a lot of folks emerged out of ‡ Brooklyn, our first spot [‡ Sista's Place] was on the corner of Jefferson and Nostrand, Jefferson begins at Claver Place, and Claver Place is where ‡ The East was, at 10 Claver Place. So you just walked from ‡ The East right up to ‡ Sista's Place, so its almost a geographic and physical part of that [East] legacy. 


Many of the artists who have played here talk about the atmosphere when they play here, that they feel so comfortable they just enjoy playing. The artists [who play Sista's Place] are treated like royalty, they're not background music for people's discussions, people come here to hear the music. I remember when I was in college and I went to visit Cornell for some reason and we heard ‡ Don Lee [[Haki Madhabouti]] — he hadn't become ‡ Haki Madhabouti [same as Don Lee] yet, reading. I remember during his reading he had to stop at one point and tell them they had to shut up and listen because people were talking, it was disrespectful, and that was the first time I thought about that. People ought to respect the art, and so that's what we do at ‡ Sista's Place is the most important thing we have are the artists. We don't always have the resources to pay them what they're worth, but we always make sure we pay then what they agree to. Over time there have been a few grants that have helped out, but it's really what walks in the doors that pay the artists. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Is ‡ Sista's Place a not-for-profit? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: Yeah. And if not enough people walk through the door [artist fees] come out of our pockets. Like ‡ Abbey [[Abbey Lincoln]] said, 'the artists gotta get paid', so that's our position. And I think the artists appreciate that, they know when they come here that they are treated and regarded as the important contributors and continuum of our culture. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What you're saying about the artists' perspective on a place like this — and there have been so few in this country — we got a good measure of that yesterday when we interviewed ‡ James Spaulding. He talked about playing at ‡ The East and playing at ‡ Sista's Place. The first thing he talked about was looking out at a sea of faces that look like me. And he talked about the audience interaction. For him ‡ Sista's Place felt much the same as playing at ‡ The East. This strikes me as a 21° century continuum of the whole idea behind ‡ The East. How would you compare the two? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: He's great. I think it's true. I went to ‡ The East a couple of times. The first time I saw ‡ Betty Carter and ‡ The East was cultural nationalist with politics on the line and the whole atmosphere there was something that you immersed yourself in and you felt very comfortable, and it emerged out of the struggle of the 60s around black power, black nationalism, and black culture.


‡ Sista's Place has emerged out of the continuation of that struggle around the struggle for black folks' right to self-determination, to own and control our own things, to exercise dominion over our culture and not have it taken off and commercialized and stolen by other folks, as is the history of just about everything in the United States of America, and so there is that continuation. I think given the changing conditions in 2010 and 1970 that ‡ Sista's Place represents that. Some of the folks you've interviewed that were a part of ‡ The East, they come to ‡ Sista's Place. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Having gone to ‡ The East and now being an integral part of the operation here at ‡ Sista's Place, when you come here for a performance does it feel very similar? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: Yes, it feels very similar; people come in and they feel almost like they're listening to live music in their home. That's what a lot of the artists say, that's what people say, that 'I feel at home here. We had a birthday celebration here for ‡ James Spaulding a few weeks ago and he was so ecstatic. They performed and we had birthday cake and everything and the glee on his face was ecstatic, you can tell that he really enjoys playing here, and it is reciprocated — and that's the continuation of ‡ The East. The performances here are a living interaction; the performers feed off the audience and the audience feeds off the performers. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Things have changed in a number of different ways since ‡ The East. Back then they established the place as purely for African Americans. That apparently wasn't the policy at ‡ Sista's Place. Given the fact that ‡ Sista's Place audiences are not exclusively black, does it still engender the same type of atmosphere? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: Yeah, because most of the time the white folks that come here are in the minority; this is not an organization or place where a minority can come here and dictate the atmosphere for the majority. And as long as folks don't act rowdy, there's not a problem. It helps pay the band. That's not really an issue because the audience is predominantly black and we set the tone of what happens here. There are some [white] people who come here who are regulars and they're real cool. Sometimes we get people who come here from abroad and there really haven't been any problems. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Its gotta be a bit of a revelation for people who come here from abroad to experience a typical ‡ Sista's Place audience, as opposed to going to some of the more traditional jazz clubs in Manhattan. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: Yeah, I guess for them it's sort of like when they go to black churches on their tours. When we first started people would come here and say 'oh, this place should be in the Village...' Why can't this place be in the black community in ‡ Brooklyn, why's it gotta be in the Village?!? Why can't we have this quality in our community? We charge $20-25 dollars for what they charge $50 for at ‡ The Vanguard, plus a minimum. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ Sista's Place also seems like a modern incarnation of places like the ‡ The East in terms of being 501[c][3] not-for-profit. What have been some of the benefits of being not-for profit and what kind of grant support have you been able to access? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: The benefit is being able to access some grants; we had a grant from BET at one point. We have not been able to access as many grants as we should because we are a black organization and people are very clear what our position is around stuff. So I think that's probably been a factor in terms of not being able to get as many grants as we might otherwise. We've been able to survive because we have a core of people who volunteer to do this work, nobody gets paid either here or in the market, and that's why we've been able to sustain it is we have people who are committed to continuing this as an important symbol of what it is black folks are able to do in the interest of black folks. If we were paying folks we would have gone under, so this is a part of people's political commitment to provide the highest quality of life to people in our community. This has been all volunteer from 1988 when we were first setting up the market] out on the street, All of the funding comes internally, from fundraisers and people in the community. 


‡ Sista's Place and the market have been an anchor for the re-gentrification of this area, because when we came here this was a crack block, people were just doing whatever they wanted. We cleared all that out in our area and we said this isn't going to happen. In an ironic sort of way it has created the conditions for folks trying to get us outta here. They're trying to get us outta here, that's why we're in a different location because the landlord… there's too much community support for us so they're doing it gradually. We're looking to raise the money to get our own spot because you've gotta control your own space. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What are some of the programs here besides the jazz presentations? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: We've had games nights where people have come and played chess, checkers, whist, scrabble, dominoes and those type of games. We've run some educational things out of here; there's a writer's workshop run by ‡ Louis Reyes Rivera every other week where people come and get help with their writing. We've had some plays, it's also a spot where different folks meet; we rent it out for wedding showers and parties; we've had a film series, a book club called the Revolutionary Book Club. So it's been pretty much open to the community. We have an open mic where young people come... We've done a lot of things over the 15 years.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What is your jazz presenting season? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham: Our season runs from Coltrane's birthday [9/23] through the first or second weekend in June, then we shut down for the summer because there is so much stuff happening. But we usually do one or two shows during the summer. We open for the season on September 25. When we first opened I think it was ‡ Leon Thomas in '95. 


‡ Sista's Place has become an institution in ‡ Brooklyn as a cultural spot. We're going to continue it regardless of the intentions of the landlord or the powers that be; it is a continuation of a legacy of culture as a “weapon" that ‡ Brooklyn is famous for.

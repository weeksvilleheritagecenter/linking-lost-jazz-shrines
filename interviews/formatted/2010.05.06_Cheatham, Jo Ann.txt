Interviewer: Are you a native of ‡ Brooklyn?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: I was born in Harlem and I came to ‡ Brooklyn when I was four years old.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: So you’ve lived all your adult life in ‡ Brooklyn?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Except for one year, when I lived in the Bronx.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: What has been your experience with jazz music in ‡ Brooklyn, and how did your experience with jazz in ‡ Brooklyn start?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham:  It started when I was a teenager, and I guess “Poinciana” [‡ Ahmad Jamal’s hit record] was out when I was like a pre-teen.  Young people that I hung out with were into jazz.  I remember my mother playing music like ‡ Dave Brubeck and those other kinds of people. Even though she played the music she didn’t particularly care for jazz musicians because of the whole substance thing.  I remember that when I got older she talked about the times she went to the ‡ Savoy (Ballroom), then I got caught up in the disco craze and I kind of stepped away from the music.  I remember seeing ‡ Monk [[Thelonius Monk]] in Central Park, maybe one of his last performances; and then I got into different types of music.


What made me become more of an advocate for jazz is that I’m a counselor for the New York City Public Schools and we were giving black history presentations – in the middle 90s – and the person who coordinated the program had someone come… his name was ‡ C. Scoby Stroman.  And I was always a fan of singers… ‡ Nat “King” Cole…  So Scoby came and we talked about a lot of different things and we became colleagues, and he said he’d take me around to jazz events.  He took me to ‡ Jazz 966 and I became their photographer.  Scoby and I began hanging out at the different places – ‡ Jazz 966, ‡ The Flamingo Lounge… there was ‡ Brownies, and there was ‡ Tony’s…


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: Where was the Flamingo Lounge?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: ‡ The Flamingo Lounge was on Kingston Avenue; ‡ Ed Stoute played there, ‡ Kiane Zawadi… ‡ The Flamingo Lounge was there for billions of years!  It was worse than ‡ Slugs, the bathroom was even worse than ‡ Slugs, and it was just a little tacky bar, but they played the best music, they had the best musicians.  I hung out with him there, and we went to different places in Manhattan.  ‡ Brownies was on Bergen Street, on a little side corner; there’s a bar still there I think.  ‡ The Flamingo Lounge was on Kingston between Lincoln Place and St. John’s.  So I hung out, I’d been to different jazz concerts but this was like my entrance into jazz.


One Sunday, I always watched the program “Like it Is”, and ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] called me and said “we hit a 3:00, at Thompkins Square Park, be there…”  It was like 1:00, but when ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] said be some place, you’d be someplace.  And what it turned out to be was the first Charlie Parker Festival in Tompkins Square Park.  And ‡ Billy Higgins, and ‡ Max Roach, ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] danced, ‡ Jackie McLean… those kinds of things.  ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] said ‘listen, there’s this new club that opened up, there’s this new trumpet player, you gotta see him.  We walked in and it was ‡ Roy Hargrove, it was his first time playing in New York.  That’s been my experience.  And with my photography I was meeting all kinds of people, and I happened to be in the old ‡ Birdland – not the one in the 40s, on 110th Street.  I walked in and this guy started playing the vibraphone and it was ‡ Stefon Harris, his first time playing in New York.


I gave a photography show and I did a poetry reading for a fundraiser for Judge Bruce Wright’s re-election, it was the only ‡ Brooklyn fundraiser for Bruce Wright and I had [saxophonist] ‡ Roland Alexander. I used to go to the African Street Festival, which has now become the International African Arts Festival, and that’s how I got to know Roland and the other musicians.  There used to be something called the Clove Hill Festival [sp?], outside ‡ The Muse, which used to be located on Lincoln Place and Bedford – ‡ Kiane [[Kiane Zawadi]] taught there, Roland taught there…  That’s how I met Roland to hire him to work with my poetry.


I had a photography show and I hired ‡ Ed Stoute and ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] to play, and ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] became ill.  All of that time that ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] and I were friends he’d say to me “I want you to meet ‡ Randy Weston, I go by his house every Thanksgiving…”    But somehow we never met.  ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] became ill; ‡  Scoby Stroman was a dancer, drummer and poet, who played with ‡ Randy [[Randy Weston]]  and ‡ Max [[Max Roach]] and everybody, but he became ill and passed away.  Before he passed we were planning a fundraiser for him and he told me ‘you gotta contact ‡ Randy [[Randy Weston]]…’  But ‡ Randy [[Randy Weston]] was out of the country – this was 1995.


‡ Scoby Stroman used to have an organization called SOFOCUS, a Society of Folk Called Us, and it dealt with cultural enlightenment about food and the music, and everybody loved ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]].  There was a person named ‡ Leroy Applin, he and ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] were good friends. ‡ Leroy [[Leroy Applin]], ‡ Ed Stoute, somebody named Davey, and myself decided to revitalize SOFOCUS.  We began giving musical presentations all over: people’s backyards… we produced ‡ Kenyatta Beasley at places like ‡ Up Over Jazz Café; ‡ Barry Harris at ‡ Medgar Evers College… places like that.  For about 3 or 4 years we presented.  When Lee [?] became ill people in‡ Brooklyn – many organizations were beginning to come together to bring jazz back to ‡ Brooklyn – I don’t jazz ever left ‡ Brooklyn…  So that was ‡ Sista’s Place with ‡ Viola Plummer, ‡ Torrie McCartney…


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: Did you experience jazz at ‡ The East?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Oh yeah.  I was there for legendary performances by ‡ Leon Thomas and those kinds of things.  At that time I was expanding my music, and jazz was not the focal point of my life as it is now.  ‡ The East was a spiritual place.  It was tiny and it was filled with a lot of culture, a lot of good music, a lot of good people, and many good things were happening there.  So I guess I did experience ‡ The East.  It’s not a good thing that no one saved it.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: What was an average evening like at ‡ The East in your experience?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: It was about the music.  When you walked into ‡ The East there was a feeling that came over you that the music was gonna be dynamic.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: What was it about the place that gave you that feeling?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: It’s such a cliché, but the vibes… A combination of the people, the atmosphere, the conversation, the hipness…  I never went to ‡ The East and had a bad time, a bad performance.  There was never any fighting or anything like that.  It was crowded… the [clientele] people always looked healthy, they looked good, their clothes… it was just nice.  I know that’s not a very good description, but that’s the way I felt about ‡ The East.  It’s almost like Mecca…  It’s like I need to see ‡ Randy [[Randy Weston]] four times a year, and if I don’t see ‡ Randy [[Randy Weston]] four times a year it’s a bad year.  It’s like if someone came to ‡ The East, you had to go.  


It’s like if ‡ Pharoah [[Pharoah Sanders]] was in ‡ Brooklyn [at ‡ The East]; the music was like a high, but it wasn’t a drug thing to me.  They talked about the healing powers of music, when you’d go into ‡ The East it was a healthy thing.  If your spirits were down and you were having problems, when you went there it  opened you up, it gave you a sense of direction sometimes; you could meditate by yourself or with whomever you were with.  Whenever ‡ Pharoah [[Pharoah Sanders]] appeared on a Saturday night at ‡ The East, everybody was all hopped up about ‡ Pharoah [[Pharoah Sanders]]; no one ever articulated this, want you’re asking me about ‡ The East, because you knew this was the thing to do [go to ‡ The East].  People knew not to miss this concert, because they knew the music was gonna be telling the truth.


There was something about the truth factor in the music at ‡ The East, so to ask that question is like asking how do you breathe, because people didn’t go on a Saturday to see a jazz concert, they went to see ‡ Pharoah [[Pharoah Sanders]].  This was deep, it was an experience, because for people who followed the music at that time, it was spiritual.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: As you looked around last Saturday evening at the Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium concert with ‡ Pharoah Sanders, was it déjà vu?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Some of the same people.  It was like going to see ‡ Nina Simone, you didn’t ask why did you go to see ‡ Nina Simone…  you go because what she’s gonna give you, you just go because it was ‡ Nina [[Nina Simone]].  So you’d just go to ‡ The East because you knew you were going to be edified.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: Who all did you see at ‡ The East?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: ‡ Pharoah [[Pharoah Sanders]], ‡ Doug [[Doug Carn]] & ‡ Jean Carn, ‡ Leon Thomas, ‡ Gary Bartz, ‡ Betty Carter… that was like a while back [laughs].


I was the official photographer for ‡ Jazz 966 for at least four years.  That meant that every Friday night between September-December and February-June, I was at 966, I wasn’t going to Manhattan [for jazz].  So everybody who came through ‡ Jazz 966, I was there, and I took their picture; ‡ Bill Doggett, ‡ Etta Jones and ‡ Houston Person, ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]], ‡ Ed Stoute, ‡ Kiane Zawadi, ‡ Cliff Lee – Malcolm Lee’s father, Spike’s uncle…  I did start going to the ‡ Blue Note.  The old heads didn’t like the clubs because they were expensive.  I listened to the old heads who said ‘they’re ripping off our music, it’s not doing so and so…  So I tended to stay local [‡ Brooklyn] for at least eight years.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: What places in ‡ Brooklyn were you going to besides ‡ Jazz 966, and ‡ The Flamingo?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: ‡ Sista’s Place; I did go to ‡ Tony’s Grand Dean once, but that was back in another time.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: You’re someone who gets around to these various places for music and who has experienced these audiences at different places.  Is there a difference between the audience in ‡ Brooklyn and the audience in other places?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Manhattan people think they’re hipper, they think that Harlem is the birthplace…  I forgot about the ‡ Arlington Inn, the ‡ Sonya Ballroom (Akbar Hall)[a], I forgot about ‡ The Blue Coronet, the ‡ Baby Grand [[Baby Grand Brooklyn]]…  Is there a difference in the audiences [between Manhattan and ‡ Brooklyn]?  Yes, and the difference is ‡ Brooklyn people tend to be more serious about the music; that’s why ‡ Monk [[Thelonious Monk]] was [playing in ‡ Brooklyn], that’s why ‡ Max [[Max Roach]] was here…  When ‡ Monk [[Thelonious Monk]] was put outta the clubs [lost his cabaret card in Manhattan], he made his living playing in ‡ Brooklyn.  


I remember when I was in my late teens, I saw ‡ Monk [[Thelonious Monk]] playing at the ‡ Arlington Inn.  And I remember all those clubs on Fulton Street: the Blue Coronet, the ‡ Arlington Inn, ‡ Akbar Hall [[Sonya Ballroom]]…  Yes, the crowd was different [in ‡ Brooklyn]; the music tends to be a little different, not as rich in Manhattan as it is here for me.  If you have a large amount of African Americans it’s a different audience also.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: Do you think it has anything to do with the fact that in Manhattan there is a natural tourist trade in a lot of the jazz clubs that you wouldn’t necessarily get in ‡ Brooklyn?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: With the clubs, yes, but it depends upon the musician who you’re going to see.  ‡ St. Nick’s Pub [in Manhattan] tends to get a large tourist crowd.  When you’re in a club like ‡ Birdland, or the ‡ Blue Note, you have to have a certain posture – you can’t yell out, that’s etiquette, and that’s while sometimes the experience is different.  The musician needs that [audience encouragement] to feed off of, to give something back.


I went to see ‡ Maurice Brown for his CD release party at the ‡ The Jazz Standard; I’ve seen ‡ Maurice [[Maurice Brown]] at different places recently – ‡ Harlem Stage, ‡ Solomon’s Porch, ‡ BAM – but there was no yelling and screaming [at ‡ The Jazz Standard] until the end; there’s less call and response in Manhattan.  Because jazz is a business, the clubowners tend sometime to shape the way jazz goes, because of who they hire, and what they want to do if they’re making their dollar.  So if these people come from Japan and they go to the ‡ Lennox Lounge, they’re going to get a different show than if they go to ‡ Sista’s Place.  If you go to ‡ Sista’s Place, everybody’s yellin’.  You get no poetry, no spoken word in Manhattan; you don’t get a lot of soul, a lot of substance in Manhattan; in ‡ Brooklyn you get that.  


Unfortunately we only have two or three places in ‡ Brooklyn – ‡ Sista’s Place, ‡ Jazz 966, and someplace called ‡ Pookie’s, on Bedford Avenue.  When I go to Manhattan I know what to expect; I go to the ‡ Blue Note, I happen to like ‡ The Jazz Standard, I like ‡ Dizzy’s…  Dizzy’s is a special place.  


I saw a lot of the music at the [Brooklyn] African Street Festival, I used to be their documentarian.  So I saw ‡ Sun Ra, ‡ Abbey Lincoln, ‡ Roy Hargrove…


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: Talk about the development of the Central Brooklyn Jazz Coalition.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: In 1999 ‡ Torrie [[Torrie McCartney]], ‡ Alma Carroll, and they had gotten ‡ Jitu [[Jitu Weusi]], and we had a meeting at Sugar Hill.  The first Central Brooklyn Festival happened in April 2000.  And that’s when Jazz A Woman’s Viewpoint, and Pure Jazz [magazine] first came out.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: What’s Jazz A Woman’s Viewpoint?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: The concept behind Jazz A Woman’s Viewpoint was… the International Women in Jazz was elitist, and they were also not African American, and ‡ Roslyn Blair, who was also a founding member of CBJC (and was a member of Just Us), didn’t like that.  She was angry that she felt [International Women in Jazz] didn’t give enough highlight to the grassroots people.   So she decided she was going to have this panel discussion to talk about that; she got women who were wives and family members of musicians to talk about the music and what they had experienced; that’s how we came together.  


When Roslyn passed I produced a program that had ‡ Joanne Brackeen, ‡ Melba Joyce, ‡ Bernice Brooks (a drummer here in ‡ Brooklyn)…  At ‡ Roslyn’s [[Roslyn Blair]] funeral, ‡ Alma [[ Alma Carroll]]  said that we would always have that program as part of our permanent program.  I was always annoyed that no one ever talked about the women behind the musicians.  That’s why in every issue of Pure Jazz [magazine] I have a column called Jazz Woman, a woman who does not play an instrument or sing, and the column is founded in the spirit of ‡ Nellie Monk.  Every issue of Pure Jazz you’ll see a woman who is behind the scenes.  


Now you have parlor jazz in ‡ Brooklyn.  ‡ Marge Elliott, who used to take care of ‡ Andy Kirk – and she lives in the Andy Kirk building, which is at 555 Edgecombe Avenue – she gives a concert every year at the ‡ Morris-Jumel Mansion every year in late August, in honor of her son who was killed.  She gives a free concert and pays the musicians out of her pocket.  These are the women behind the scenes; those people never get talked about but they still perpetuate and promote jazz.


~BLOCKBREAK~


Interviewer: Talk about the development of your magazine, Pure Jazz.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: It came out of ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]]; when we were going out to different places…  Because I had worked on a magazine called Unique New York when I was in college in the 70s [Hunter College].  I was in school and somebody called me and said there’s a posting for a new magazine coming out, you better go there and don’t be late.  So I went, and the guy hired me.  I worked with that magazine for about four years.  Then I had a magazine called Teen Lines.  


I work in the school system and at that time I was working in a middle school and some money became available, my major at Hunter was Communications, production and everything, so why I didn’t do video I don’t know, but I decided to do this magazine called Teen Lines, to help teens save and spend their money wisely.  The children would do all the articles, go visit the people – banks, where to buy the best sneakers, etc.  So on our first cover was MC Lyte, and our other cover was Malcolm Jamal Warner, also Dr. Ruth, and our last cover was Kid & Play – in color!  So I knew what to do with magazines.  I had students in high school on work/study come and help us in junior high school, so I knew kind of what to do with a magazine.


So ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] and I would go around and we would read Down Beat and Jazziz… and I would say ‘where are the black jazz magazines…’  [Every issue of Pure Jazz is dedicated to ‡ C. Scoby Stroman and Jim Harrison.]  What happened was Scoby’s brother had passed and he was going to sell the house.  He said ‘when I sell the house, I’ll give you some money to start that magazine.’  And ‡ Scoby [[C. Scoby Stroman]] passed and I used my own money, until I got a grant.  


The content of Pure Jazz all comes out of my head, it's all been a personal quest because I am at heart a historian.  I used to work for Weeksville, for at least four years.  I wanted Pure Jazz to be different, it has become a jazz literary magazine.  I was talking with this Jewish guy I worked with and told him I was going to start a magazine called Pure Jazz, African American classical music.  He said ‘what, can’t white people be in the magazine?’  I said no, I didn’t say that, I said you do you I’ll do us…  But now there’s a problem, because when I started out African American classical music… first I went three years to obtain the title.  I talk about history, the women [in jazz], I have a crossword puzzle, and I wanted to have interesting things for the reader to appreciate in the magazine.

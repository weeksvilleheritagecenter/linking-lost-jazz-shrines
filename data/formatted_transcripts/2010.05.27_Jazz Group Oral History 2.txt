‡ Willard Jenkins: Do any of you have any recollections of the ‡ Kingston Lounge?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: Just that the bar was in the middle of the room.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: That’s at Kingston & Bergen.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: I think I have a flier from that place.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Where was the stage in relationship to the bar?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: I don’t remember anything else; I wasn’t that old [laughs].  I lived near there and I used to look inside.  The stage was in the back.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ Tony’s [[‡ Tony’s Grand Dean]] was at Grand & Dean.  I’ve heard people refer to it as “‡ Tony’s Grand Dean,” did they actually call it that or did people just say it that way because it was at the corner of Grand & Dean?


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: That’s the way I’ve always heard it as “ ‡ Tony’s Grand Dean”, as though it was all one word.


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Willard Jenkins: Did any of you frequent  ‡ Tony’s [[ ‡ Tony’s Grand Dean]]?


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Harold Valle: No…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: It was a little before my time.


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: I always heard about it.


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Harold Valle: There were stories about ‡ Vincent Jones, who ran the back room where the artists played.


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: That’s ‡ Donald Sangster’s friend?


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Harold Valle: Yeah,  ‡ Vincent Jones.


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Willard Jenkins: Did he do the booking?


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Harold Valle: I don’t know if he did the booking or not, but it was he who spoke to the owner saying that he wanted to utilize the back for music.


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Willard Jenkins: Was it your sense that  ‡ Tony’s [[‡ Tony’s Grand Dean]] was like two different operations, with the bar on one end and the music room on the other?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: Yeah.  The gentleman who took photos of the goings on [in the music room]… several of the photos have appeared in magazines, ‡ Jimmy Morton.  ‡ Vincent Jones is deceased.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: (Next slide) OK, that’s the ‡ Putnam Central. Do any of you have any memories of that place?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: ‡ Monk played there, that’s all I ever heard.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: My father [[‡ Harold Cumberbatch]] played there many times with his smaller groups, but I wasn’t around.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Did he play with any of his big bands at these places in Brooklyn?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: He played there with Ray Abrams [‡ Ray Abrams Big band].  My mother would know about the ‡ Putnam Central, she frequented that place many times.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: You’ve never been inside [‡ Putnam Central]?  You walk in a smaller room and there’s a big room with a stage; they rent it out still.  There’s a tiny stage, the room is kinda small.  I’ve always felt that should be a landmark; ‡ Leroy Applin danced there, ‡ Randy [[‡ Randy Weston]] played there…  I’ve been to a wedding reception there, within the last 15 years. Everybody knows the ‡ Putnam Central in ‡ Brooklyn.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: It appears to have been some mansion of sorts.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: There’s a photo of Randy, when he was real young playing there; I’ve seen that.  They have a photo of ‡ Wilson Hayes, and Leroy Applin dancing in suits.  Talk to ‡ Elaine Applin, ‡ Leroy [[‡ Leroy Applin]]’s wife, she’s still very much alive.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: We need ‡ Elaine Applin’s contact information.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: She danced almost weekly at that place.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: This next slide you all recognize, ‡ the East.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: This is where I did some of my first professional gigs, at [[‡ the East]].


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: When you played at ‡ the East, what context did you play?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Usually trio or quartet, with Rasheen[a] on bass, sometimes I accompanied myself on piano, I don’t remember who the drummer was.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Everybody talks about how special the audiences were at ‡ the East.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Oh yes.  I remember one time I was on a bill with ‡ McCoy Tyner, and I told him its an honor to be sharing the bandstand with you, and he said ‘its an honor to be sharing it with you.’


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ The East was consistent in the memories of those who came up in the 60s and 70s in ‡ Brooklyn.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: That’s right, and like I said, it was a jazz mecca.  All the boroughs would come to ‡ the East on Saturday nights, to see people like ‡ Rahsaan Roland Kirk, ‡ Pharoah Sanders, ‡ Leon Thomas, Doug and ‡ Jean Carn.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So you walked in that door at #10 Claver Place and went downstairs?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: No, you went straight to the back, [performance space] was in the back.  They told you about the famous East Punch?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Yes, and the kawaida rice.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Um hmm, no alcohol…  didn’t need it, the music made you high [laughs].


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: I forgot to mention, on the corner of Putnam Avenue, near Fulton Street there was a theater during the 1920s called the ‡ Putnam Theater, and ‡ Mamie Smith played there.  I think I have a copy of the flier.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: That’s the band that ‡ Coleman Hawkins came out of, ‡ Mamie Smith & the ‡ Jazz Hounds.  What happened at ‡ the Elks?  That’s a place we didn’t really talk about.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: I don’t know anything about that particular lodge.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What was the former name of the ‡ Slave Theater?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Was it a movie house called the ‡ Bango?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: My father took me there when I was small because they had afternoon jazz shows, like ‡ Big Maybelle.  I thought it used to be the Brooklyn Apollo?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: No, the ‡ Brooklyn Apollo is at Throop and Fulton.  This is Bedford and Arlington Place.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Yes, this was the place I saw ‡ Big Maybelle; I remember my father took me backstage to introduce me and she hugged me and I disappeared in her dress! [laughs]  What a voice, oh my God!


(Next slide is the ‡ Blue Coronet, across Fulton Street from the Slave Theater, now a pharmacy.)


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: I remember seeing the trumpet player, ‡ Howard McGhee there.  [Owner ‡ Dickie Habersham-Bey] touted ‡ Howard [[‡ Howard McGhee]], said he was a very nice individual. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: What happened to the ‡ Arlington Inn?  Don’t you have pictures of that?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Yeah, it was at the corner of Fulton and Arlington Place, right?  Does anybody remember ‡ Town Hill?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: By the time I started going there they were having R&B shows.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Right, me too.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: Yeah, I remember going there.  I saw ‡ Joe Williams there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: It was on Eastern Parkway & Bedford.  What about the ‡ Turbo Village?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Where was it?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ Turbo Village was at Halsey & Reed.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Wasn’t there a club around the corner from the ‡ Slave Theater where they say ‡ Monk [[‡ Thelonious Monk]] used to play?  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Lucky Spot, at 307 Grand Avenue, under the subway tracks.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: The gentlemen that were here yesterday should know that.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ The Jefferson Bar?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: That came out of a newspaper, the Amsterdam News in 1949.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: These were all places that played jazz?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: The great ‡ Ray Abrams, when I used to play in his band he used to point out places on nearly every corner where jazz was played in the Bedford Stuyvesant area.  People like ‡ Ed Stoute and ‡ Randy [Weston] would know all those places.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Anybody remember a place called ‡ The Id, at the corner of East New York & [?]  What do you remember about ‡ The Id?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Yes, I remember R&B shows there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Yesterday Jimmy Morton remembered seeing ‡ Clifford Jordan play ‡ The Id, and ‡ Kenny Dorham.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: I was there for the R&B.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about ‡ the Fantasy?  OK, I’m going to go down this list.  ‡ The Tip Top Inn?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Fulton & Utica.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ Flamingo Lounge?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Yes, on Kingston & Lincoln Place.  I played at the ‡ Flamingo Lounge with [bassist] ‡ John Orr.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ Brownie’s?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: That was on Nostrand.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: I’ve heard of it.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Tulivu, did you play ‡ the Jazz Spot?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Yes, it was shortlived.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: That was a mother and daughter operation…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What kind of food did they serve?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Somebody told me that it was in a place that didn’t have public transportation, and a place that people weren’t used to going for entertainment.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Yes, it was an odd location, a little bit out of the way; it was a very small place.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: Not only that the people in the neighborhood weren’t accustomed to jazz.  I was a host there for the jam sessions on Monday.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: The décor and ambiance was very nice…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: …You’d think you were down on the East Side in the Village somewhere.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Crescent Lounge on Reed Avenue?  ‡ Willoughby Temple at Willoughby & Nostrand?


[No recollections of either.]


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ Club La Marchal, besides the famous ‡ “Night of the Cookers” recording, is there any other reason to make note of that place, at President & Nostrand?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: That was the thing that made it famous.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: ‡ Lee Blair would know something about that, Rosalind [Blair] was part of the ‡ club Just Us that put on that concert for Night of the Cookers.


[Many of these places on our list, this meeting’s participants were too young to remember.]


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: [Suddenly recalls] ‡ The Brevoort Theater was the former name of the [current] Slave Theater.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: That was where ‡ James Baldwin’s play “Blues For Mr. Charlie” was staged.  I have a flier from that play with me [provides it to ‡ Jennifer Scott for copying].


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about ‡ Smuckers at Schermerhorn &  Flatbush?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: I’ve got a flier from there; I saw ‡ McCoy Tyner, ‡ Sun Ra…  It was a large venue, gigantic…  They had a dance space, and they had a roller skating rink in the basement.  Now you have a pawnshop and a check-cashing place there…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Across from ‡  BAM…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Club 243?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Yes, Flatbush near Myrtle, it was upstairs over a car dealership.  I played there near the end with the ‡ Baritone Saxophonists, a group ‡ John Stevenson and my father [‡ Harold Cumberbatch] started.  It had a huge floor, nice for dancing and the stage.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ Grecian Cave, Flatbush & State Streets?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: They had afternoon sessions for the city employees around there.  It was run by a restaurateur who had a restaurant right there at 3rd Avenue and the corner of Atlantic, a Greek guy, so that’s why they called it the ‡ Grecian Cave.


[Harold Valle has many fliers, which he provides for Weeksville copying.]


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Where was ‡ Pumpkins?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: At Flatbush & Church.  It was a small jazz club, it was long and narrow.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: You came in the space and there was the bar to your left as you came in the door, and the music was in the back.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: They had jazz 7 nights a week.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: The owner was ‡ Bill Rutherford, it lasted into the 2000s.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What about the ‡ ValHal[b]?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: I remember working there once with ‡ Melvin Sparks.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: It was at Fort Greene Place.  During the 2nd world war the navy yard was quite active and that whole street was lined with bars.  That’s where they came for the nightlife, and as time went on each bar closed down but ‡ ValHal’s was the lone holdout.  Nobody remembers it now.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: Did you put down ‡ Pratt Institute?  That’s where ‡ Betty Carter and a lot of people played, in one of the buildings.  I heard a lot of stuff there.  They had concerts often there, in the summer months but it was inside one of the university buildings.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Did any of the gentlemen yesterday mention ‡ The Hole?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Yes, at Bridge & Willoughby.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: There was another Hole, on Eastern Parkway & Nostrand.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: No, this was down in the subway station…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: When you went down one flight…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: My father [[‡ Harold Cumberbatch]] played there all the time [jam sessions].


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Can you think of any others that we haven’t named?  What’s your recollection of the ‡ Up Over Jazz Café?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: I loved it. I liked the warmth of the colors, the way it was laid out, and the talent that appeared there.  There was always good music there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: Nice baby grand piano…  Nice sound system…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: They catered to young musicians too.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: ‡ Enos Payne had a workshop there.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: That was the ‡ Birdland of Brooklyn.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jo Ann Cheatham: ‡ Sista’s Place is a shrine.  I remember the night ‡ Wynton Marsalis played ‡ Jazz 966.  He said “…hmm, there’s a lotta soul up in here…”  That was a great night.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: I didn’t hear anything said about ‡ Eddie Freeman’s ‡ Sugar Hill, on Nostrand & DeKalb.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What happened there?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Harold Valle: ‡ Sugar Hill has been an establishment in the community for over 30 years, one of the oldest continuing black-owned businesses in central Brooklyn.  They have shows up there.  ‡ Alma Carroll always has an affair there, including jazz.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch: We can’t leave out the churches that have had jazz presentations, like St. Phillips Episcopal, the House of the Lord, Concord Baptist Church, Siloam Presbyterian Church… it’s a blessing to have these churches open their doors to jazz artists.  I’m doing a jazz program every other month at Siloam to benefit Haiti.  St. Phillips has an annual jazz concert as well.  ‡ Sankofa, at Macon & Verona is one of the new spots on Friday nights for jazz; it’s a brownstone.  She uses the living room, every Friday night at 9:00.[c]




[a]??
[b]Maybe Valhalla / Scopello's?
[c]Should we add these churches since people performed there?

‡ Willard Jenkins: Are you a native of Brooklyn?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Yes I am. I was born in ‡ Brooklyn on October 25, 1939. My early memories are of the bombing of Pearl Harbor – December 1941 – my dad in the Army, living with my mother on Lexington Avenue. We lived on the 2nd floor and a lady on the first floor used to take care of me when I was 3 or 4 years old. We lived on Lexington until I was about 5 years old and we moved shortly thereafter to Kosciuszko St. There were 7 of us, 4 boys, 3 girls; me and my brother were the oldest. We lived there about 5 years, and then we moved two blocks away to Clifton Place. 


As far as Bed-Stuy is concerned these are what you might call the bottoms. Usually when people talk about Bed-Stuy they talk about Stuyvesant, Decatur, MacDonough, Lewis [streets]… they talk about the brownstone Bedford-Stuyvesant. Down where we lived that was not the brownstone Bed-Stuy, that was the woodstone Bed-Stuy; mainly wooden, frame houses with stone on the bottom foundation, but these were the bottom blocks of Bed-Stuy.


I went to PS 54, when I went to school it was a K-8 school. I graduated from 8th grade at PS54, I never went to Junior High School. In my pre-teen years there were a few things that impacted me. I remember one Saturday night my mother took me and my brother to one of the downtown movie theaters – it coulda been the Majestic Theater. They had a vaudeville night that night, I was maybe 10 or 11 years old. That was my first time seeing a live show. It was a variety show: comedy, singing, instrumental music… it was like a variety show.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Was this a black show?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: No, it wasn’t totally black, but it was at least half or more black. They had what you might say rhythm & blues.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What are your earliest memories of jazz music?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: The next thing that happened to me – I was about 12 years old now, and my cousin Charles Morris had a newsstand. I was the first born of my generation and he called my mother and he said ‘I want Leslie’ – that was my name until I changed it – I want him to work at the newsstand on Saturdays, come down and help me. So that started a new era in my life, going down to the newsstand on Saturdays. 


Every Saturday morning I would get up about 7am and be out of the house by 8, by 8:30 I was at the newsstand and I would be there from 8:30 to about 6:30, 7:00. I had a number of tasks to do; in those days you prepared your Sunday papers with the various sections on Saturday; so I would put together the Daily News, the Times, and the Tribune. The main news section usually came about 8pm on Saturday night and you just inserted them in there and the papers were ready to be sold. The newsstand was located right on the corner of Fulton and Franklin. Fulton and Franklin at that time was a very, very hot corner. It was hot for two reasons – Ebbets Field and Coney Island; you got the train to go to Ebbets Field and Coney Island at Fulton & Franklin. So people would come out of that subway and make it to the elevated line upstairs and get those trains. So from March-October there was a lot of traffic. That was a very trafficked area anyway; blacks had just started to move in that area. 


Across from the newsstand, on the southeast corner was a record store called ‡ Sam the Record Man.  Now, ‡ Sam the Record Man, like all good record stores, had this loud outdoor [sound] system, and they used to play records all day long. Many of these records I had never been exposed to before. It was my first time being exposed to people like ‡ Ruth Brown, ‡ Fats Domino… a lot of the early progenitors of rhythm & blues; but also he would play jazz: ‡ King Pleasure, ‡ Charlie Parker,‡  Billie Holiday, ‡ Ella Fitzgerald… he played different vocalists as well as instrumentalists. After awhile I began to know who was who, and what their tunes were. My cousin and his brother – they were the two male figures that operated the newsstand – my cousin Charles Morris was the oldest, he was a disabled vet and it was under his auspices, his disability, that he was able to get the newsstand. His brother, Leroy Morris, worked with him. Leroy’s nickname was Lefty, and he was very athletic, and he knew all the jazz guys; he knew ‡ Willie Jones, ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: This is Lefty Morris the basketball player?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: That’s right, you know him?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: He talked ‡ Randy Weston into going to the Berkshires. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: That’s right, he knew all the jazz guys… He knew ‡ Scoby [Strohman], ‡ Willie Jones, ‡ Max Roach… these guys used to come by the newsstand all the time, even if he wasn’t there. I was ‘youngblood’… [it was] ‘hey youngblood, what’s happening man…’ Like I said, I was 12-13 years old. They were glad to see that I was halfway alive, halfway awake… I’d always been into reading the newspapers and I knew who was who, like Mao Tse Tung, Stalin… I knew people. If they’d given me a current events quiz I could whiz through it because I knew people, I knew figures. They used to always tease Lefty, ‘yeah man, I came by and youngblood was there and we laid out there and talked about world politics for awhile…’ So that’s when I had my sort of baptism to the music and to the community.


A third thing I remember during that period was, my cousins Lefty and Charles’ sisters, they were like in their early 20s. At my 13th birthday they took me to the New York Paramount to see a stage show and it was an all-jazz stage show. I remember it was ‡ Count Basie and ‡ Joe Williams, ‡ Sarah Vaughan and ‡ Teddy Wilson, ‡ George Shearing… it was about 3 or 4 acts. I remember that show vividly; it was the first time I’d seen a big band (‡ Count Basie band), they swung pretty heavily. I remember ‡ Joe Williams and his blues singing… it was a real good show. I enjoyed myself and learned a lot about the music. That cousin, Shirley Morris, was a heavy ‡ Sarah Vaughan fan. She had all kind of memorabilia from ‡ Sarah [[Sarah Vaughan]], she knew who ‡ Sarah [[Sarah Vaughan]] had been married to, and she knew everything there was to know about ‡ Sarah Vaughan. I remember later on, when ‡ Sarah [[Sarah Vaughan]] died and they had her funeral over there in Newark, she was sick and wasn’t able to get down here for the funeral, so she sent me over there to take some pictures. Those things were my first opening to the music and the people.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: From there how did your interests in jazz develop? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Well, during my teens I really didn’t get into too much related to jazz – I guess I was normal like everybody else, I was into the rhythm & blues craze, the stage shows, ‡ Frankie Lymón & the Teenagers [‡ Frankie Lymón] and all that kind of stuff, and going to the parties and all that. At about 17 I was working in the camps upstate and I started listening to jazz much more often. I started buying a few more records. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Who were you listening to and who were you buying? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: I was buying ‡ Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers [‡ Art Blakley]  [‡ Jazz Messengers] – I remember that “Blues March”, this was ‡ the Messengers where he had ‡ Bobby Timmons, ‡  Lee Morgan, ‡ Wayne Shorter, ‡ Jymie Merritt… And I was listening to ‡ Horace Silver, “Senor Blues” and his different compositions. I liked ‡ Horace Silver’s music, I liked ‡ Art Blakey… those were the opening, sort of teenaged years of listening to records.


Then I remembered that I had a little girl friend when I was about 19, she used to live up in the Dunbar Houses at 150th Street and 7th Avenue, and her mother was very, very strict – like 12:00 at night you had to go, ‘she gotta go to church in the morning, she gotta do this, gotta do that… 12:00 you gotta hit the road young man.’ I found this place right at 155th and 7th avenue called ‡ Brankers, a music bar. 


What was happening at ‡ Brankers really was prostitution, but I didn’t know all that, I couldn’t see all that. ‡ Brankers was like a meeting spot where all these guys would come and hook up with their lady friends and go upstairs. But in between, they had live music downstairs; they had ‡ Kenny Burrell, ‡ Grant Green, ‡ Shirley Scott – these trios, it usually was an organ player, a guitar player, and a drummer or an organ player, a saxophone player and a drummer. I’d go to Brankers at 12:30 and I could sit there until 2:00 a.m. listening to music. I could buy a beer and nobody would bother you; get out of there, catch the train and go home. That became another thing that introduced me more to the music.


In the summertime I used to go up in the Catskill Mountain areas to work up in these camps. When I was about 20 I went to this camp called Wingdale on the lake. At some point during that summer this guy named Bill Tatum became the entertainment director of the camp and we became friends. After the summer was over he told me to keep in touch with him, he was going to get me some more work. By that time I was a waiter, I used to wait tables in the [camp] dining room. 


When I called him he told me he was working at ‡ Wells, upstairs room, on 133rd & 7th Avenue – [home of] chicken & waffles. I had to go down and get my cabaret card and he got me a job working at ‡ Wells. ‡ Wells was real good because I didn’t come to work until about 1 or 2:00 in the morning, so I could go to my little parties, hang out with the girls and whatnot and get up to Wells at 2:00. Girls used to ask me ‘what kinda job you got that you gotta get there at 2:00 in the morning?’ I said ‘I’m a waiter, I wait tables in a nightspot.’ But, people didn’t know that the secret to ‡ Wells was the dancehalls used to close at 3:00, and after the dancehalls closed everybody came to Wells [to eat]. Mr. Wells had everything covered. So we didn’t make no money until 3:00, but if you worked from 3:00 to 8:00 you could make a pocketful of money.


I had nights where at 3:00 I hadn’t made a dime, but between 3:00 and 8:00 I’d make $60, and back in those days $60 was $60. So Wells was good to me as a work spot. And also I stayed close to the music. They played a lot of ‡ Dakota Staton, ‡ Gloria Lynne and all that kinda stuff. But every now and then they’d have a trio, so I heard more live music too. Of course now I’m getting older and I know where the different radio stations, I’m listening to ‡ Symphony Sid, I’m listening to different radio stations. By the time I got to ‡ Wells jazz was pretty much my number one enjoyment music, and the #1 music I spent money on. If I had to take a girl out someplace, we usually went to a jazz club.


By that time, about 20-21, I had begun to dabble in ‡ Miles Davis, ‡ Coltrane, a little ‡ Cannonball Adderley, etc. In fact I even got so absorbed, I remember my 20th birthday I took this girl to the Five Spot to see the opening of ‡ Ornette Coleman; they were making a big deal over ‡ Ornette Coleman and I wanted to check him out. His kinda music was like way out there, but it was good that I checked him out because that was gonna be the music to come. So now my musical tastes are broadened out and I’m into a wider range of artists. I could see the many facets of jazz – Latin Jazz, avant garde, hard bop… I could see and recognize different aspects.


At a certain point [Bill] Tatum and Joe Wells fell out. I remember I went up to work one night and Mr. Wells told me ‘…Bill no longer works here, I fired him… he took my money, I fired him…’ Of course that was his way of telling me that was [my] last night too. But the good thing about that experience was it gave me a cabaret card. Back in those days you couldn’t work in anyplace that had live music without a cabaret card.
~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So this went beyond just something the musicians had to have to work? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: That’s right, waiters, waitresses… So I now had a cabaret card but no job. Meanwhile I’m going to Long Island University and the summer of 1961 I had to go to summer school, because I wanted to graduate on time, which was June 1962, I had to make up a couple of courses and also I wanted to be eligible to teach. So I had to take a couple education courses, I took four courses that summer – so that put me in summer school for the two sessions. That meant I had to be in class from 9am-3pm everyday, M-Thursday, so I couldn’t get no job. So it started off as a very poor summer for me.


One particular night we went down to the ‡ Village Gate to see somebody. While I was there I heard this woman who was like a manager say ‘I need some waiters, we’re getting ready to have a whole lot of important people in here, there are going to be good crowds, and I ain’t got no waiters…’ She went back to her office and I made my way back to her office and I said ‘miss, I heard you talking to the guy that you need some waiters, I’m a waiter.’ She said ‘oh really’? I said ‘yeah, I used to work in Wells upstairs room in Harlem.’ She said ‘do you have a cabaret card’? I said ‘yeah…’, she said ‘you’re hired’. So the next day I started working at the ‡ Village Gate. That was like golden, I saw everybody: ‡ Nina Simone, ‡ Thelonious Monk… everybody; I not only saw everybody, but I got to meet everybody. Everybody wanted to know ‘who’s this guy youngblood, who’s he’? So I got to meet everybody, and everybody knew me. These guys that I had listened to, like ‡ Art Blakey… I knew ‡ Art [[Art Blakey]] now! I got to meet all these people.


I found out that some of them lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant, like ‡ Ahmed Abdul-Malik, the bass player, he lived on Green Avenue. So I remember that after the set, he would play with ‡ Herbie Mann, and after the set he would say to me ‘youngblood, you goin’ to ‡ Brooklyn? Come on, I’ll give you a ride’ and he would take me home. So it really was a good period, the period that I was at the ‡ Gate [[Village Gate]], that was a period in which I really became a solid member of the jazz fraternity.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What was happening jazz-wise in ‡ Brooklyn at that time? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Brooklyn was coming along… First of all, ‡ Brooklyn had a lot of things going on club-wise – bars, clubs… When I was at the newsstand, the ‡ Putnam Central Club was hot then. I used to hear Lefty, my cousin, and all those guys – Willie Jones – talking about ‘aw man, we’re gonna hear so and so at the ‡ PCC [[Putnam Central Club]]…’ ‡ PCC [[Putnam Central Club]] that was the ‡ Putnam Central Club. But I was 13; back in those days they didn’t play around with these liquor laws and all that stuff, so that was off-limits to you if you were… I was 13 and looked 13, so I was never able to go to those places, even though I used to hear Lefty and them talk about the PCC, ‡ Tony’s on Grand Avenue [[‡ Tony’s Grand Dean]] , the place up on Halsey and Reed… I used to hear them talk about these various clubs all over the place, but I couldn’t go to these places. I remember one time I tried to go to ‡ The Continental, and I looked in there and who did I see but my other cousin, who was a cop named Raymond, he was a traffic policeman. Here I am peeping in the door and he’s sitting in the back there, so I got the message ‘don’t mess around.’ My mother always made us very, very conscious about the law and things you weren’t supposed to do, etc., so I was pretty aware of what I wasn’t supposed to do and where I wasn’t supposed to be. Yes, there was a very active jazz scene in ‡ Brooklyn during that period.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: And you said a lot of jazz musicians lived in ‡ Brooklyn when you were coming up? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: That’s right. First they lived in Bed-Stuy, and later on they migrated over to what is now known as Crown Heights – which is up there around St. Marks. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: When you did that walk-through for Weeksville you and ‡ Randy [[Randy Weston]] went to the ‡ Kingston Lounge; that’s one of the few remaining that still has the original signage outside.


‡ Jitu Weusi: Yes, I wish that I could hit the lottery or something and be able to buy that place and put it back in order. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What was the ‡ Kingston Lounge like? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: It was a bright, beautiful place. It was like something you would see in Harlem, it looked so modern and up-to-date and they would always have live music in there.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: I’ve heard people say that during the 50s and the 60s ‡ Brooklyn actually had more jazz clubs than Manhattan. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Probably so, because Manhattan was more captured by that rhythm & blues, which they were translating it more then to rock & roll, that was the new gold mine, so jazz was sort of pushed to the side. Aside from ‡ Birdland, the ‡ Village Gate, and the ‡ Village Vanguard, those were the only three that I remember being steady jazz clubs. There were a lot of jazz clubs that would open up for like 6 months, a year, and then they would be gone. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: When you became of age to be able to frequent these kinds of places in ‡ Brooklyn, what was the scene like? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: The scene was not bad. When I was 21, which was about 1960, the scene was not bad, there were still some clubs that we could go to. Key among those clubs was ‡ The Blue Coronet. I was a frequent visitor, especially when I started teaching – which was about 1962 – to ‡ The Blue Coronet. We had a little crew of men and women who worked in the schools and we would call each other [and ask] ‘…who’s at ‡ the Coronet tonight…? Let’s go down there.’ The ‡ Blue Coronet was the top [Brooklyn] club at that time. ‡ La Marchal had sort of come and gone, it wasn’t a prominent club even though ‡ Freddie [[‡ Freddie Hubbard]] and them made a record in there that sort of gave it glory, it was not a prominent jazz club; every now and then they’d have somebody there, but it was more like a supper club. 


‡ The Continental had sort of come and gone too, their best years were in the 50s. By the early 60s they were more of a bar and less of a jazz club. ‡ Tony’s [[Tony’s Grand Dean]]  was there, but the ‡ PCC [[Putnam Central Club]] had closed and changed ownership. ‡ Tony’s [[Tony’s Grand Dean]] would have shows every now and then, they didn’t have regular shows. That place on Halsey’s & Reed – I think it was called ‡ Rusty’s Turbo Village – they had regular music there. And there was a place on Vanderbilt & Gates… I know  ‡ Rector Bailey  used to hold down the chair in there, the organ player. That was also another regular jazz hit. Then you had a lot of bars that, every now and then they’d have somebody there: ‡ Berry Brothers, ‡ Tip Top [[Tip Top Inn]], ‡ Monaco [sp?]… there a lot of bars, which were destroyed basically by the drug trade; every now and then they would have somebody in there playing.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡  Willard Jenkins: So as you evolved as a fan and an enthusiast of the music, how did you come to escalate your involvement to the point where you became an activist and even an entrepreneur? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Jitu Weusi: I graduated from Long Island University in June of 1962 and I became a teacher in September of 1962. Being a teacher, now I became interested in the music not only from an enjoyment perspective, I now became interested in it from the point of view of an educational perspective. I did experimental things like play different music in my classes… Kids would tell me they had never heard any music like that. I remember the first time I played ‡ Olatunji’s “Drums of Passion” in the class, oh man there was so much excitement, and it was a heavy turn-on. ‘Wow, what’s that, where did that come from, who is that?’ 


So I saw that the music had a lot of educational value, turning on youngsters to various sounds, various performers… ‡ Oscar Brown, Jr. was another person that I used in my classes, different sides that he made. “Dat ‘Dere”, ‘Signifyin’ Monkey,” “Bid ‘em In”… So I now thought of ways to use the music as a motivator in the education of youngsters, especially in the area of social studies. Now the music became a valuable kind of tool, more than just my listening; now I listened for different purposes and different meanings. 


My own repertoire continued to broaden, my collection continued to broaden… I remember one particular thing, at a certain time I was exposed to the music from “Black Orpheus.” That brought me into contact with the African population of Brazil and their story. I remember I took a class to see “Black Orpheus,” it was playing at one of these art theaters. I remember their whole reaction to seeing these black people speaking a different language and having a different kind of culture… ‘Wow, who’s that, where are they at?’ It sparked a whole lot of questions when we got back to school, ‘…how’d they get there, what language were they speaking…?’ 


The music now became [sociological] and worldly, universal… not just located in the United States, as a universal commodity, all over the world. So as that took place, that also involved me; I began traveling different places… I remember my first experience, which was around 1966 going to Newport to the jazz festival. That experience had some instructional value to me. In fact I remember – I didn’t know this at the time, but I could have never stayed in Newport, because the money to stay in Newport was like way, way up there. So we ended up staying in a place called Fall River, Massachusetts.


I didn’t know at the time the history and background of places like Fall River, and New Bedford, that these were places that basically had an African-based population, from runaway slaves and so forth that intermarried with a lot of the Portuguese that lived in those areas. And there was a very strong kind of cross-fertilization between those communities and the African community, so when I came up there to stay for Newport I found a lot of people that were very supportive and very glad to have us stay there. All of that helped to broaden me and broaden my understanding of the music and the people, and the backgrounds and how it fit in. 


I began to see this music now in a more historical context. My mother used to listen to certain people, like ‡ Louis Jordan. She told me about ‡ Chick Webb and different people like that. At the time when she was telling me about people like that [lack of interest]… but now, by the late 60s all of this begins to tie together, like a historical pattern that’s beginning to develop; and now I’m beginning to see this in the context of different time periods, different things that are happening in society – now I’m beginning to see this thing in a historical, sociological, philosophical context, and I’m beginning to understand that [jazz] is a revolutionary music, it’s a music of an oppressed people that has sort of like guided a movement over the years.


So now, by the mid-60s I’ve become active in political activities. I was involved in school struggles, around the struggles to decolonize public education. We used phrases like community control and so on and so forth, but it basically dealt with the whole question of colonial educational perspectives. That was the basis for our involvement. I belonged to an organization then called the African American Teacher’s Association and we put pressure on the board of education to open up the whole school thing and to become more accepting of different cultural perspectives from other people. The curriculum basically was white. When I came into teaching they gave us some books and some curriculum outlines to follow-up on, and most of that in there was white. Like they used to say in the old days, the only two [black folks] they mentioned were George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington, that was the full extent of our history.


So now I’m beginning to go into situations where I’m dealing with Crispus Attucks, Phyliss Wheatley, the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, I’m dealing with Toussaint L’Overture and the Haitian revolution, I’m dealing with a whole broad kind of struggle of Africans for their freedom and independence. In the midst of all that is the music. Now my whole thinking begins to take on new dimensions.


I was part of the group that used to listen to Ed Williams and Del Shields on WRVR, that was our religion; we had to get home in time to listen to Ed Williams and Del Shields because all of the information was dispensed on those two shows. Our music and our politics now become more toward the same track. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Willard Jenkins: So how did you arrive at the development of ‡ The East? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Jitu Weusi: By 1968 we had founded a group called the African American Student Association. The African American Student Association were young people – 14-18. I was the adult advisor to this group, I was about 28-29. These young people were raising new stuff every day, raising new issues, new horizons, new visions, etc. every day. In 1968 we had the Oceanhill-Brownsville controversy and I was in the middle of that, and that tended to stigmatize me: ‘he’s a troublemaker, he’s a radical, he’s this, he’s that…’ So I knew that my time for public education was not going to be long.


In 1969 I was banned from the campus of Pratt Institute. We were supposed to have a program there and the president banned me from the campus. The man didn’t even know me! He just issued an edict that if I set foot on the campus, the program would not be held. So the young people said ‘we want to establish our own cultural center.’ So that summer and fall we had gotten hold of this building at 10 Claver Place. We cleaned out this building and began to restructure it as a cultural center. We had a couple of meetings and we came up with the name East. Basically that was a philosophical thing because we were dealing with Eastern values, as opposed to Western values. So that’s where the name came from, it came from our attraction to Eastern values that we felt were values that dealt with internal values, spiritual values. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Willard Jenkins: What was the mission of the East? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Jitu Weusi: The mission was to bring enlightenment to our people – recreational, philosophical… 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Willard Jenkins: So how did you work to achieve that mission? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Jitu Weusi: We worked to achieve it through a number of different things; one was through the entertainment that we provided. Our opening performance was  ‡ Leon Thomas and from the very beginning our music was always radical. ‡ Gary Bartz. ‡ Freddie Hubbard, ‡ Rahsaan Roland Kirk… our music was always out there. Then, one of the first things that we brought into  ‡ the East was the bookstore. We pushed reading, understanding, books, studying, and upliftment. And then the next thing we brought in was a school; the Uhuru Sasa School became a vehicle for us educating young people and adults as well.  ‡ The East thing was always an upliftment of a mind, a forging of a higher objective, a higher goal, a better person, and self-improvement. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Willard Jenkins: So did you pretty much have seven days of activities there? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Jitu Weusi: Seven days – almost 24 hours, because we did everything; and we learned everything. We did everything on our own: we had a kitchen where we prepared food; we went to the market, we learned how to go to the market and deal with the market here, vegetable, fruit, fish markets, meat markets, all those things. That was part of the enlightenment that people learned was how to deal with all that. People would come and tell us ‘man I didn’t know nothin’ about all this stuff until I got involved with you guys… Now I’m running this and I’m running that…’ 


~BLOCKBREAK~


 ‡ Willard Jenkins: So how did people in the community come to be involved with  ‡ the East as recipients of these services? Was it a membership kind of operation? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: It was [membership-oriented], and we didn’t take everybody. It was a membership-kind of thing and you had to make a total commitment, for the members. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: How did members prove that commitment? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: First of all, if you worked at the East you didn’t make any money. Everybody would always tease us about the salaries we made; we paid salaries like $100-200 a month, so you weren’t there because of money. Secondly, you learned how to live on whatever you made, how to survive, how to advance. It was uncanny, unbelievable, but people bought homes off $200 a month… We provided things like schooling for the youngsters, but people had cars… people used to say ‘…damn, ya’ll don’t pay any money, but everybody around here looks like they’re well-off!’ And that was, again, part of their learning. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So you saw this as a 360 degree experience? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Yes I did. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Were you the director? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Yes I was. I quit the school system in November of 1969 to devote my full time to the East. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Musically-speaking, you mentioned some of the artists who performed at the East. I’m aware of at least two live performance recordings that were made at ‡ the East: ‡ Pharoah Sanders “Live at the East” and the ‡ Mtume record “Al-Ke-Bu-Lan.” Were there any other recordings made there? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Not that I can remember, there might have been, but I’m with you… I’m aware of those two. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Talk about ‡ the East’s music policy. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: The music policy was, we had music on possibly four nights a week: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We didn’t mess with Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Some artists only wanted three nights, so we’d go Friday-Saturday-Sunday, or if they only wanted two nights we’d go Friday-Saturday. First of all, we only opened our doors to our community. We had no official policy, but unofficially the only people that came to the East were black people. That’s not to say that an individual white person here or there did not come into the East [ala Russ Musto, who reports going there frequently], that would be erroneous. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Did that became contentious at a certain point? How’d that evolve? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: At a certain point, yes. Initially they didn’t pay that any mind, because [hypothetically speaking] ‘…who was ‡ the East?’ But after awhile, when the word started getting out that there was this place, that the musicians really played there, and you could hear the music, they [audience] didn’t do no talking, wasn’t no bottles clinking, wasn’t no noise… people were into the music, this was a serious place. Then people started trying to come, people started coming, and we had to more or less inject that policy, but that was after I’d say maybe two years. Let’s say we started in ’70, it wasn’t until ’72 that we began to have that problem. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: And how did that problem arise and manifest itself? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Like I said, the word started getting out. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: No, I mean how did that problem come to a head? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Well… [chuckles]… it came to a head, in about ’77 when [white] people wanted to bring their children into the school and we had to draw the line. Some of us said yes, and some of us said no, and that eventually caused a [schism] in our organization. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Was the Uhuru Sasa School a regular K-12 school? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: K-12, yessir. Yes, it was certified. One of our elected officials, a state senator by the name of [?] was very, very helpful. He came to the school one day and he said ‘…man, you’d better get this certified, because if you don’t get this [school] certified they’re going to try to close you down. What you’ve got going on here, they’re going to try to close you down, so he backed us up with the state Department of Education, and he more or less guided us through a number of different situations with the state, like for instance you had to have a certificate of occupancy; we didn’t have a certificate of occupancy for 10 Claver Place as a school. So we moved the school down to this place in Gowanus [sp?] on Barnes Street, for the purposes of the Department of Education inspection. So when they came to inspect us we were in this church on Barnes Street, and the church had a certificate of occupancy as a school. And so, boom, we passed the inspection by the state Department of Education and we got our certification. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So this was in effect an earlier incarnation of what we are now referred to as charter schools? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Maybe so, yeah, except that we didn’t get the money that charter schools get; we didn’t get $5,000 per student, we didn’t get any lucrative grants or stuff like that,,, 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡  Willard Jenkins: So how did you subsidize the school? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: That was part of what the music did. The music helped us to pay for running the school. Take a typical ‡ Pharoah Sanders weekend; a ‡ Pharoah Sanders weekend meant for us a $5,000 dollar weekend. That meant that we could go to the bank Monday morning and put in $5,000 in our account; which meant we could pay teacher’s salaries, we could buy food, we could do this, we could do that… 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: The musicians who played at ‡ the East were black musicians, and at least among the musicians you listed who played the East there’s a certain consciousness among the musicians who played the club. In terms of how they were compensated, is ‡ the East a place where the musicians would give you a break where they may not have given the same fee break to some other venues around New York? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: I would think so, yes. Everybody that played [‡ the East] got paid, nobody played for free. But they never charged us what they might have charged a ‡ Birdland, or the ‡ Vanguard… 


What we served was very good food, everybody talked about the food at ‡ The East; guys couldn’t wait until they had finished their set to send [their orders] down to the kitchen. We had chicken dinners, fish dinners and vegetarian dinners. I remember guys would send down to the kitchen for different plates. We had this vegetarian rice called Kawaida Rice, big green salads, potato salad, collard greens…. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Who was doing the cooking? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Her name was Lottie Brown, and the Lord sent her to us. When we first opened we had mass confusion in the kitchen, with everybody talking about how they could cook – they couldn’t cook. We were going crazy, we had to find somebody. I was living on Claver Place at the time and I went around there to Claver Place one afternoon and I had my head down. This woman said ‘what’s wrong with you, you act like you got the blues, you got your head all down…’ I said ‘oh, Miss Lottie, how you doin’, I need a cook…’ She said ‘oh, you do?’ She said ‘well, I used to be a cook. I used to work in a restaurant.’ I said ‘oh, will you come around [to The East] and cook?’ She said ‘well, I tell you what, I need $125 a week.’ I said ‘we don’t make but $50 a week, where we gonna get $125?’ She said, ‘well, if I’m going to do it, that’s what I want.’ 


So we discussed it and we agreed that we would pay her the $125 a week. Well that was one of the best moves that we made. She came around, took hold of that kitchen, she moved people around – she had this one doing this, that one doing that; she had people whose only job was peel and cut potatoes. Then she another one whose only job was clean greens, wash greens, cook greens… In a month’s time she had that kitchen humming. We used to produce sometime 300-400 plates of food per night! That’s a lot of food coming out of one little kitchen a night, but it was only because of her that we were effective in doing that. Food became a major way that we earned money through ‡ The East to pay for our expenses. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What was the duration of ‡ The East? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: The major duration was from about 1970-1977. After ’77 was stage two, which went from ’78-’86; in ’86 we closed down. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What was different about stage two? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Stage two was less music, not music every weekend, just music every once in awhile. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Was that because of the monetary requirements of presenting music? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Well, no, it was also because we had moved. We moved from 10 Claver Place to an Armory on Sumner; we had a larger venue, but the venue wasn’t as cozy, the sound wasn’t as good, it had a high ceiling which sucked away all the sound. The venue wasn’t as good, so we ended up having music once a month. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ The East spurred the development of a major Brooklyn festival? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: It started off as the African Street Festival, later on it became the International African Arts Festival. It happened like this: In 1970 and ’71 we noticed a pattern; the pattern was we would run out of money at mid-end of June, and we’d have debt. My thing was always pay off debt, don’t accumulate any debt, figure out ways to pay off debt. So we wanted to figure out a way to make some money to pay our debt at the end of June, because June was the end of the school year and a lot of people would travel [then] and the people we had [working there] during the summertime would be different people – college students, people who wanted to come in and try out for awhile; more or less a transient crowd we’d have during July and August. The regular people would come back in September, our regular teachers would return and so forth.


So the thing was to pay off our debt so we wouldn’t owe anyone going into the summer. So we discussed what to do and after awhile we came up with the idea of having this 3-day block party on Friday, Saturday and Sunday on Claver Place, which is a little compact block between Franklin and Classon, and its also where Jefferson Avenue begins, so it’s sort of like in a T [configuration]. The idea was to have this block party on this T and invite people to come down, move our whole entertainment thing outdoors, build a stage outside, and then we would sell food and have various merchants all up and down the block, sell merchandising space and so on. 


Everybody said that sounded good, sounded like it could work. The first year we did that, which was 1972, it started raining on Friday, and it rained all night Friday night, it rained all day Saturday, it rained all Saturday night. But when it stopped raining on Sunday morning at about 11:00 and the sun came out about 1:00, people jammed that little block… there must have been – no exaggeration – 10-15,000 people on that little block, from 1:00 Sunday until midnight, and it was fantastic… music, dancing… it was like something that you dreamed about; nobody had ever seen anything like that in that little space, and outdoors like that. And everybody made money. So even though two-thirds of it was rained out, the one-third that survived was enough to tell us that we had hit on something.


The next year, 1973, we cleaned up… No rain, we ran it for three days, the crowds were enormous, boom – we cleaned up, everybody made money, we paid off our debts, the community was happy, we were happy… The only ones unhappy was the Catholic church. One thing that happened is, people come out on the block… the Catholic church had a yard there and they claimed people were peeing in the yard, different things. They had some higher balconies [outdoors] and they claimed photographers would go up there and shoot from the balconies and what not, taking pictures. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So you had to make peace with the church, and how’d that happen? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: That’s a famous story. ‡ Chief Bey – ‡ James Hawthorne Bey – came over to ‡ The East one day and he said to me ‘I’m going to take you over to the church and we’re gonna make peace…’ [Laughs] I’m a warlike type of person, ‘peace… get outta here…’ But I had a lotta respect for the ‡ Chief [[Chief Bey]]. So he took me over to the church, we lit candles, prayed, the Father came down and we talked, and when we left out of there everything was cool, everything was alright. We reached a compromise that they would let us have the festival [‡ East Annual Festival] that year, at Claver Place, but the next year we would move that festival up to Boys & Girls High School, which had much more space to accommodate what we were doing, as opposed to that little space on Claver Place. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So how did the festival evolve to become International? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: After I left in n’78, everything got compartmentalized, then it became the International African Arts Festival. It has maintained – this is the 39th festival this year – and the basic tenets are still in place: as far as arts, economics, culture… the basic tenets are still in place. Even though it has lost some of its originality, the basic tenets are still in place and I’m very pleased with that. It’s very hard to find something that lasts 40 years that is still the same as it was the first year. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: When did the ‡ Central Brooklyn Jazz Coalition come into existence? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: The East stopped having music around ’79 or ’80. They had a few shows up at the Armory during the early ‘80s. Reaganomics began to have its full effect by ’84-’85 and a lot of businesses were effected. So by the mid-late ‘80s jazz was on a real downturn, almost all of the old stuff was wiped out in one way or another: all the old clubs, all the old venues, it was just a bad downturn. In the early ‘90s came on the scene this woman by the name of ‡ Torrie McCarthy, she was a singer, but she also was a link between a lot of artists and places to perform. And she was the one that convinced ‡ Sam Pinn to do ‡ Jazz 966 over at the senior citizens center on Fulton & Grand. So ’92-’93 they started having [jazz] shows there every Friday. 


‡ Torrie [[‡  Torrie McCarthy]] branched out, she went to other bars, other venues, downtown Brooklyn, and had shows. She became known as [a musician who] if you lived in Brooklyn and wanted to work, you tried to funnel through ‡ Torrie [[‡  Torrie McCarthy]].  By the end of the 90s ‡ Jazz 966 was firmly established, and somehow ‡ Torrie [[‡  Torrie McCarthy]]  and ‡ Joe Carroll’s widow ‡ Alma came together. There was this new place that was opening called ‡ Sista’s Place – ‡ Viola Plummer – they came together, and between all those places they came up with the idea of trying to form some kind of a collective around jazz and the germ of the ‡ Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium took shape.


They also had this idea of having a festival in April. It was October of ’99 and ‡ Alma Carroll called me and told me to come over to this meeting at ‡ Sugar Hill restaurant. I said ‘what is this all about?’ The said ‘we’ve got some proposal we want to make to you.’ When I got over there that’s what they’re talking about, starting this organization the ‡ Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium and they’re talking about this festival, and they want me to put this together. By now I certainly knew that I have organizing skills, so I agreed to do this and little did I know that it was going to blossom into what it did blossom into.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So how is the ‡ CBJC [[‡  Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium]] doing today? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: There are at least about a half-dozen venues [involved in the ‡  CBJC [[‡  Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium]]] today; there’s ‡ Sista’s Place, ‡ 966 [[‡ Jazz 966]], ‡ Sugar Hill restaurant, ‡ Afro Arts Design, ‡ Williamsburg Music Center, ‡ Rustic Tavern, ‡ Two Steps Down… and they continue to grow. The festival, which started off with 9 days, has gone to 30 or more days with like about 40 different events happening, and we’re attracting people back to Brooklyn: musicians, artists… that haven’t been here in 30 or 40 years. Last week we had almost 700 people come out to see Pharoah Sanders. I’d say that we’ve rebuilt a bridgehead, we’ve rebuilt an important venue as far as music is concerned. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Throughout this timeline, you’ve talked about the early joints when you were a kid, and now here today the ‡ CBJC [[‡ Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium]]. Why has this jazz activity always seemed to center around Central Brooklyn? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: Central Brooklyn is the black belt of New York City. When I used to go to Chicago – I loved Chicago, I went to Chicago first as a child of about 14, then I used to go back at least once or twice a year – I used to love Chicago and I never could figure out what I liked about Chicago, but now I know. And that is because you could go to the south side of Chicago and it was like the black belt of Chicago – black restaurants, black shops, black businesses, black bookstores… everything on that south side was black.  In a segregated society that we live in, it gives you a feeling of strength to go into an area where blacks own something, blacks dominate something – you feel a sense of strength, a sense of achievement, and a sense of power. And I think that’s what’s happened here in Brooklyn. 


When you crossed Flatbush Avenue and came east, all the way to the Queens line that was the black belt; you saw black people, businesses, stores, houses, culture, etc. And there was a feeling of strength here. Since the ‘60s when Harlem was afflicted with that drug situation, that has drained out of Harlem; the Harlem of today is nothing like the Harlem we once knew, and basically it’s because of what happened in the ‘60s with that drug scourge. Brooklyn is still strong in that context and I still think that people get a strong feeling of black strength when they come into Brooklyn, much like they got in Chicago.


One other thing I wanted to talk about is ‡ Randy [[‡ Randy Weston]]’s father [‡ Frank Edward Weston]. ‡ Randy [[‡ Randy Weston]] was out of the country a lot, and his first entrée to me was to send his father to me; this was in the early ‘70s when I first started ‡ The East.  ‡ Pop Weston [[‡ Frank Edward Weston]] used to come by, sit outside and talk, and of course he was a Garveyite. The kids just loved to hear him talk, talking about the old days of Garvey, about different aspects of the Garvey movement; he was an educator in that context and they loved to hear that. I never will forget, one day he came down there to 10 Claver Place with these two sweet potato pies. They sat out there and ate those pies… it was like a fraternity was so pleased at their enjoyment of those sweet potato pies that this became a regular ritual; at least once a month he would have to come down to ‡ The East and bring some pies. He’d bring the pies and talk, and they would just love it.


Finally it was about 1972 and ‡ Randy [[‡ Randy Weston]] had come back home; [Sp?] ‡ Gonsalves[a] did most of the bookings for ‡ The East and he agreed to get ‡ Randy [[‡ Randy Weston]]  to come to play, and Randy came and played his first set at ‡ The East. I remember that too because I didn’t know ‡ Randy [[‡ Randy Weston]]’s son, ‡ Azzedin [[‡ Azzedin Weston]], until that set and ‡ Azzedin [[‡ Azzedin Weston]] played with ‡ Randy [[‡ Randy Weston]]. He had a quintet but ‡ Azzedin [[‡ Azzedin Weston]] played with that quintet. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Did you record privately the things that you presented at ‡ The East? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: We did, but like everything else as to where they are, that is like a state secret [laughs]. When ‡ Pharoah [[‡ Pharoah Sanders]] played last Saturday [April 10, 2010] somebody told me they had a tape of one of ‡ Pharoah [[‡ Pharoah Sanders]]’s performances at The East. They said “why don’t you get him to let us make that into a record.” I said “man look, I’m on good terms with this man don’t have him think that I’m trying to bootleg his tapes making records…” 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: The way things are now, I’m surprised tapes from performances at ‡ The East haven’t shown up on the internet. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: They’ve kept them pretty much to themselves, but I could tell you five people right now who have tapes from ‡ The East. They were recording as sort of like a little group. ‡ Ron Warwell lives in Georgia, he has these tapes; Maliki [sp?] has these tapes; a brother named Segun [sp?] has these tapes… I know about five people that I would bet my bottom dollar have some tapes from ‡ The East. I don’t have any, but I’ll go to somebody’s house and they’ll play me some tape from ‡ The East. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Did it ever get to the point where anybody challenged ‡ The East’s blacks only admission policy, or went to the authorities about that? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Jitu Weusi: No. The only person that I was really hurt by was ‡ Elvin Jones. It was so funny because when we were down at ‡ the Gate [[‡ Village Gate]], I met ‡ Elvin [[‡ Elvin Jones]] at the ‡ Gate [[‡ Village Gate]], and at the time I worked at the Gate, me and him were [tight], I used to have a lot of respect and love for that brother. He was just a beautiful brother. I never thought that he, of all people, would object to our policy. So here it is now, 13 or 14 years later, about 1973 and ‡ Mensah [[‡ Kwesi Mensah Wali]]] makes a deal with him to come to ‡ The East, so he’s going to be there on Friday and Saturday and we’ve advertised him and expect a real good turn-out. 


I should have known that trouble was on the way; he sent this white guy over to bring his drums and set up his drums. We had a lotta code words at ‡ The East and somebody called me from downstairs: “ ‡ Elvin [[‡ Elvin Jones]]  sent [a white guy] to set up his drums, what should we do?” I said “let the man set up his drums.” So he comes in and he sets up the drums. Then that night, it’s 9:00 and here comes ‡ Elvin [[‡ Elvin Jones]] strolling in with his – I don’t know, girlfriend or whatever. So they always leave the tough jobs for me. [Staff] said ‘man, you gotta come down here and talk to this guy, he done brought [a white woman]…’ So I took ‡ Elvin [[‡ Elvin Jones]] aside and told him I didn’t want to embarrass him but ‘you know, we’ve got a policy here…’ [Agitated] he says ‘I don’t care what your policy is, that woman can’t come in with me?’ I said ‘as much as I love to have you, our policy is this… I will try to accommodate you as much as I can, if you want to take her home I’ll be patient, I’ll work with you, but we cannot void our policy…’ He said ‘if she can’t stay, I can’t stay…’ So he left. By 10:30 we had ‡ Carlos Garnett on the stage [in ‡ Elvin [[‡ Elvin Jones]]’s place] and that was that. And that’s the ONLY person that we had that problem with. And we had a lot of prominent folk come through [‡ The East]. 


     
[a]Not sure who this is

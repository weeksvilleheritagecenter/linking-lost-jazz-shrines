‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: This is one of a collection of about 20 photos that were given to me by a man named ‡ Jimmy Morton. This is part of a series of photos of my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Sr.]] in Chicago about 1953 at the Beehive. My dad was real close to Max Roach, so this was the trip to Chicago – my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] was accompanying the ‡ Max Roach-Clifford Brown Quintet [‡ Max Roach] [‡ Clifford Brown] and this was the trip before the next trip, which was the fatal trip where ‡ Richie Powell and ‡ Clifford [[Clifford Brown]] died. This was way before I was even an idea. Here’s a shot of my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] at my aunt’s wedding in the late 40s, that Brooklyn-West Indian thing.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Since your father was so heavily involved in jazz, what was your earliest recollection of jazz music?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: My earliest recollections were jazz being played all the time in the house, along with fiery discussions about everything affecting us as a people – in America and globally -- my dad was a big fan of shortwave radio and he would tune in literally to what was going on around the world. I was an early adapter of the internet and all that stuff and I knew he would have been all over this digital information thing. I continue to understand more and more about what they did as young men, I’m working on the pieces for my memoirs, and I realize what was going on then.


I’ve got vivid memories of jazz being played in the house going way, way back. The jazz station that I can recall was WRVR with ‡ Ed Beach, which was the radio station for jazz at this time. ‡ Ed Beach was a hipster with a massive collection of the music. I remember as a young kid wondering how could they know who a guy was just by the instrument that was playing; I would later learn to do that myself. ‡ My dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]]  and ‡ Max Roach were friends from teen years at Boys High School. ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]  played in drum & bugle corps, as a kid and then he became this young whiz kid drummer playing with big bands. He quickly rose in the 40s and ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]  rose to be on of the architects, and my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] was right along with him. There was a group of friends who had formed a little social group that referred to itself as the Chessmen; they developed a love of chess during World War 11 so when the war ended they were avid chess players. And they would gather and hang out a lot. 


‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] lived in a big, kind of old mansion at 212 Gates Avenue. This house, I understand, had a huge living room and a huge baby grand piano and they would give these sets. As ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] became prominent he would bring other ‡ Brooklyn jazz guys to come and hang with my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] and his friends. Hence that became a scene of jazz hipsters and frontrunners in ‡ Brooklyn, a little known slice. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Was it your sense that this group of guys, the Chessmen, was hanging in clubs in ‡ Brooklyn?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: Yeah, they were hanging at clubs in ‡ Brooklyn. There was the ‡ Putnam Central, which I heard a lot about and had been a really big establishment, kind of a premier venue for dances and stuffs. Along with having these gatherings – sets as they called them – at the house on Gates Avenue, there was a period of time where my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] and his friends were promoting their own things at this place called ‡ Tony’s Grand Dean, which was on Grand and Dean Streets in Brooklyn. I’ve got a series of photos, which I let ‡ Robin Kelley use for his ‡ Thelonious Monk book, document that scene.


The interesting thing about these pictures, as with this one – which was in color – it was [using] one of the first 35mm slide cameras, the beginning of that technology and ‡ Jimmy Morton had one. Its very rare to see color shots of jazz guys from the early 50s, everything is always black & white. These slides that ‡ Jimmy [[Jimmy Morton]] has given me over the last 20 years document this scene, which I’d heard stories about countless times when the vibe would hit the right pitch at our house and the music was right, my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] and his friends would always go back to things that happened at ‡ Tony’s [[Tony’s Grand Dean]]. It was always exciting to hear these guys get really geeked up talking about what happened and I would often times be a little kid playing in the room with my toys and things but would tune in to those stories.


During a critical period for ‡ Monk [[Thelonious Monk]] when they had taken away his cabaret license, which as you know was his ability and legal right to play in clubs, so he couldn’t feed his family. So these particular gigs were gigs that helped keep ‡ Monk [[Thelonious Monk]] alive during a period when they had taken away his legal right to play [in Manhattan clubs]. ‡ Robin [[Robin Kelley]] even found a little ad in the Amsterdam News archives of one of those gigs at ‡ Tony’s Grand Dean that ‡ Jimmy Morton blew up and I framed.


A few years ago when I caught back up to ‡ Robin [[Robin Kelley]] as he was about to release the [Monk] book he was telling me all these stories about my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] and I hadn’t recalled telling ‡ Robin [[Robin Kelley]] all this stuff about what happened at ‡ Tony’s [[Tony’s Grand Dean]] and my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]]’s whole group of friends, later when I asked him he said that ‡ Randy Weston had told him all those stories. ‡ Randy [[Randy Weston]] is still really lucid and remembers everything. ‡ Robin [[Robin Kelley]] was asking me…he said ‘damn ‡ Fab [[Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]], its funny’ – because the photo in the book, which is the greatest of the photos I have [from collection ‡ Jimmy Morton  gave him] is a photo of ‡ Monk [[‡ Thelonious Monk]] in the foreground, ‡ Miles [[‡ Miles Davis]], ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]], ‡ Mingus [[Charles Mingus]] on bass…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Yeah, I’ve seen that photo from ‡  Jimmy [[‡ Jimmy Morton]] ’s collection; he has that hanging on his wall and he showed it to us when we visited him, and the original is in color.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: People that are aficionados – I’ve got one buddy who is a ‡ Miles [[‡ Miles Davis]] fanatic – say ‘man, I’ve seen every photo of ‡ Miles [[‡ Miles Davis]], what the hell is this?’ Of course I’ve got all these heavy stories… What we found out, which is an extension of the great work that ‡ Robin Kelley did, was the reason ‡ Robin [[‡ Robin Kelley]] couldn’t find an ad for the performance that the photo depicts… the reason was because what ‡ Robin [[‡ Robin Kelley]] and ‡ Jimmy Morton figured out is that they didn’t take out an ad because it wasn’t to be public knowledge that Monk was performing this gig. Having your cabaret taken away was like driving a car without a license; if the cops found out you were going to jail.


Having heard the stories about ‡ Tony’s [[‡ Tony’s Grand Dean]] and ‡ Monk [[Thelonious Monk]] and just dozens of different stories growing up, ‡ Robin [[‡ Robin Kelley]] went in deeper because he interviewed one of ‡ Monk [[‡ Thelonious Monk]]’s siblings about the fight that almost broke out between ‡ Miles [[‡ Miles Davis]] and ‡ Monk [[‡ Thelonious Monk]] or  ‡ Monk [[‡ Thelonious Monk]]’s brother. They were rehearsing for this gig at ‡ Tony’s [[‡ Tony’s Grand Dean]] and ‡ Miles [[‡ Miles Davis]] was trying to tell ‡ Monk [[‡ Thelonious Monk]] how to play it and in the book ‡ Robin [[Robin Kelley]] writes about how ‡ Monk [[‡ Thelonious Monk]] had to check ‡ Miles [[‡ Miles Davis]], it was about to go to fisticuffs [laughs].


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: You talked about these sessions these guys used to have at the house at 212 Gates Avenue; what were they like?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: That was more like jam sessions, the musicians would come and play, and it was just like a scene… I guess the thing that was infectious to me was the enthusiasm and the energy they would have when they would get into those conversations. ‡ Jimmy Gittens, who I should say was such a huge, huge influence on me and what I even do now, ‡ Jimmy was like a big brother/uncle to me… It was ‡ Jimmy Gittens, ‡ Lefty Morris, my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]], ‡ Willie Jones (the drummer; a major activist)… It was ‡ Willie Jones, my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] and them that were together when they assassinated ‡ Malcolm X at the Audubon Ballroom. ‡ Willie Jones was very active in community politics in Brooklyn and also in Harlem at that time and ‡ Willie [[‡ Willie Jones]] would always have – the reel-to-reel [tape recorder] was what real jazz aficionados had back then, which I always remember in the house; but ‡ Willie Jones had a small portable one, which I thought was really cool.


He would record ‡ Malcolm [[‡ Malcolm X]]’s speeches, because ‡ Willie [[‡ Willie Jones]]  had a relationship with ‡ Malcolm [[‡ Malcolm X]] at that critical point in his life. I remember ‡ Willie [[‡  Willie Jones]] would record those speeches and give a copy to ‡ Malcolm [[‡ Malcolm X]], and these speeches would also be circulated amongst their friends so I’d hear a lot of those as a little boy. When ‡ Malcolm [[‡ Malcolm X]] was killed ‡ Willie [[‡ Willie Jones]] was recording. One of the first bullets went through the microphone of ‡ Willie Jones’ tape recorder and the microphone activated the recorder. I remember them many times playing that over and over and discussing that tragedy; you literally hear ‡ Malcolm [[‡ Malcolm X]] coming into the room and [greeting] the crowd, and then you hear a commotion in the distance, and then you hear somebody stand up and yell “get your hands out my pocket…” and that was the diversion and the other guys got up and shot ‡ Malcolm [[‡ Malcolm X]]. My dad and ‡ Willie [[‡ Willie Jones]] saw this go down, panicked and ran to the back of the room to hide.


I should also point out that along with all this music being played, and this energy around this music which was always being played around the house -- the jazz stations, the music, the tapes, a whole span of music -- a discussion of world politics, where we were as a people was also of paramount importance.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Were musicians part of those discussions?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: From time to time. ‡ Willie [[‡ Willie Jones]] was always there, and ‡ Willie [[‡ Willie Jones]] was an activist… He was at my house three days of every week until I was an early teenager; he was like a fixture at my house, along with at least three other guys.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: At what point would you say that you became more conscious of what they were about?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: I was always conscious, as a little boy I was aware of these things and I would hear these tapes, but I was pretty much still a kid and playing with army men and stuff that kids would do. As I think back to a lot of those things I realize I was more aware than I probably was at the time; I can remember things very vividly and can understand in a broader sense what their main concerns were. I’m a kid with all my issues being taken care of by my parents, so I didn’t get to experience what they knew as a black man you had to experience at that time. Especially when musicians went on the road and how they had to live, the situations these young, intelligent men were forced to deal with when they went out into these different environments and were very actively concerned with making change.


I’m saying all that to say that I also realized later in life that my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] was a big part of ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]’s consciousness and awareness at that time.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: How so?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: You hear it in music, it was all more further explained to me when I grew up and as an adult ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] would explain these things to me himself. One of my earliest remembrances of a ‡ Max Roach record is the “Freedom Now” suite, “We Insist”, that record. One of those records has a photo on the corner of ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] and some men sitting at a lunch counter and as a very small boy I always wanted to know what this was about. My dad and them would explain this to me. I destroyed a lot of my parents’ records as a kid playing with them, but the images on those records – there was great photography at that time, abstract art, etc. I would later see records and I’d be like ‘oh my God’… 


My mother had all the jazz singers – ‡ Sarah Vaughan, ‡ Nancy Wilson, etc., etc., and my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] had a nice collection of a lot of the bebop records and they would listen to them both. But my mother was always into the singers. My mother hung out a little bit with ‡ Dinah [‡ Dinah Washington], she hung out a little bit with ‡ Etta Jones, and I remember the imagery from these records. So if I see them know I’m like ‘Oh my God, I’ve seen this, I know this’. I have a little collection of photos and I think I was developing my visual sense at that time through looking at and playing with these records, but particularly the “Freedom Now” suite. As I grew up and got to understand a little bit more about ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] I realized that was one of the first protest records; the beginning of the 60s, the beginning of anti-war protests, the whole cultural revolution that transpired at that time. I realize that ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]  was at the forefront and my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]]’s influence, because when they came to my house my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] pretty much held court. He had read the complete works of Mao, Marx, and Lenin, all of this stuff… He got onto this stuff while he studied economics to be an accountant.


As a black man realizing that we’re not getting a fair shake, nor have we gotten one, he was exploring and looking at these other possibilities before they became the foundations for these other movements. He had absorbed and had an understanding of all this ahead of the curve.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: When you say that your dad had an influence on ‡ Max Roach as far as his consciousness about movements, explain that.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: As I said, my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] had read all the works of Mao, Marx, Lenin, also African nationalists – my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] wanted my middle name to be Lumumba, but my mother wasn’t going for it [laughs], but I later learned who Lumumba was and how incredible these guys were and how a lot of my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]]’s ideas were right in terms of alternatives that were much more viable – whether they worked or not in other countries, 30 or 40 years later we can see that those things didn’t pan out as they were sketched out in those books… But that’s what went on at my house. These guys would roll up and do their thing, listen to music, and have these intense discussions and debates. Often my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] would have the most insight because he had read the most and had this kind of broader understanding of what was going on in Africa, what was going on in China… as all these African countries were getting their independence… I guess it was a really buoyant, exciting time if you were an intelligent person who was aware and concerned. If your father had been down with Garvey and that whole [sensibility]… 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What is your sense of how the music interacted and spurred some of that discussion?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: My sense of it was this… I spent a lot of time sitting around the kitchen table where a lot of these discussions would happen…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: …Because the music was obviously more than a soundtrack…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: Yes, absolutely… My dad’s den/study was in the basement, where the real shit would go down. ‡ Thelonious Monk – as I’m growing and becoming a young teen – I’m beginning to now discern who the musicians are that I like, that I’ve been hearing forever and ever. ‡ Monk [‡ [Thelonious Monk]] becomes that musician; I became fascinated about this whole thing with ‡ Thelonious [[‡ Thelonious Monk]]. One day I looked in my father’s phone book and I see ‡ Thelonious [[‡ Thelonious Monk]]’ phone number and I call his house and I speak to ‡ Nellie [[‡ Nellie Monk]], Thelonious’ wife]…


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: How old were you?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: Twelve, maybe a little younger, I’m not much older than that. Remember, I’m still kinda little boyish because when I think back to that I think ‘God, that’s such a kid thing to do…’ She could tell it was a little boy calling and I said ‘hi, I’m ‡ Freddie Braithwaite [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]]’s son and I want to talk to ‡ Monk [[Thelonious Monk]], I know my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] knows you.’ She was really sweet and I started talking to her and I guess I was telling her that ‡ Monk [[‡ Thelonious Monk]] was a musician that I really liked and in the course of discussing that she said ‘you know Freddie, jazz is like a conversation, and in the beginning of the conversation somebody makes a point and then they go on to explain this point.’ That’s the main thing I remember from this conversation. 


I’d been listening to this music all the time and from that I now get what’s going on: the song starts off, the theme is stated, and then these guys all go off and do their own interpretation and you could still hear the theme going through there, like that’s the point. And I got it now, this became really apparent to me and I was like ‘wow, yes…’ and now when I’m hearing songs I could understand them and see how different guys do their thing as they get into the improvisation and all that stuff. But I guess I also began to understand that the guys making this music were really intelligent and really smart and they were really aware of their times, so the music was a reflection of this, therefore the music was an articulation of the intelligence and the point of view of these very sophisticated and modern musicians.


I knew that ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] and my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] were in synch with a lot of the same thoughts and the same stuff, and then once I got older I figured out a lot of these things for myself. You just realize that these are very intelligent men and they’re very concerned – although the music wasn’t always about the lyrics, the feelings and the vibes that you could get – I’m not trying to say that all jazz music had this protest, let’s make revolution thing, but it clearly was an affirmation of us as these modern individuals, which I guess is the thing that had the most impact on me because I always saw them in that light. Those conversations that went on, I realize that these particular individuals had a lot of conversations like this. It wasn’t just my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] and his friends, which was happening with a lot of other guys at that level.


I remember later, when I would become a young man and spent a lot of time with ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] and things that we would do together, I remember ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] telling me how when ‡ Olutunji first came over [from Nigeria] how him and Dizzy were so excited about this new thing going on. And I remember ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]  explaining this to me because ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] was a very big, early supporter of me being involved in hip-hop music and culture. So ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]  essentially instigated us having gigs together.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: The way I read it is that some of ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]’s early consciousness of what was going on in early hip hop culture was from you.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: Oh yeah. One day ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] came to visit my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] and asked what I’m into and my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] said ‘oh, he’s into some rapping thing…’ This was before [hip hop] blew up, this was the early 80s when we were having street block parties and what not. I was already making my moves on the arts scene and I was never trying to be a rapper but I had a few rhymes that I could get on the mic at a block party and do my thing. I was not trying to be a rapper. There was a DJ across the street who had built a nice system in his crib so I would go over there and rap a little bit. So my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] was aware of this, unbeknownst to me – and my father was never into much, if any, contemporary music – with the exception of ‡ James Brown.


So one day I came home and my father said ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] had been there and “I told him you’ve been doing this rap thing with your man across the street…” Right away I get kind of nervous because I never at that point considered anything music with the developing rap scene. I knew we weren’t playing instruments, we were making sounds and we were energetic and I knew this was a new thing that I dived into full speed ahead, but I didn’t consider it music – as in musicians. My father said ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] wants to check it out, so I said OK. So we arranged a time a week or two later and he came through, on my block on Hancock Street between Lewis and Sumner – which is now Marcus Garvey Blvd. which is very appropriate.


I prepped my DJ and we worked out a little routine… Once again the music is not formulated – the four-minute rap song is not developed, it’s just in the streets equivalent to just jamming, no real structure. ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] comes by and I’m rhyming and my DJ is cutting up, he’s scratching. ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] just peeped it. We did a little 20-minute thing and when we’re walking back to the house I’m thinking ‘what the hell is ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] gonna think of this shit.’ ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] said ‘Let me tell you guys something, that shit that you and your man were doing was as incredible as anything that me, ‡ Bird, ‡ Dizzy and any of us were doing…’ I’m thinking to myself [skeptically], ‘that’s so nice, trying to placate a young teenager…’ But that’s how ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] was, always very encouraging, but I’m thinking to myself ‘yeah, right…’ because I’m not seeing this as music, this hip hop thing… 


“Rapper’s Delight” was probably out as a big record at that point, nothing really breaking crazy like it is now. It wasn’t long after that through me now making moves on the art scene and people knowing that I’m doing my thing on the downtown scene in New York, graffiti, introducing people to the beginnings of this hip hop culture that a guy who promotes a lot of things with performance artists says ‘man, I found out that ‡ Max Roach is your godfather… We were talking with him with this ‡ M’Boom group…’ And he says, ‘man I feel like why don’t you do something with ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] together…’ And I’m like thinking ‘huh, how the hell…’?


Next thing I knew ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] says ‘yeah, let’s do it…’ So then I started to have these conversations with ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] and ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]says ‘yeah, you’re in charge, put this stuff together…’ This is the kind of enthusiasm and how eager they were to check out something new, which is the point that ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] made to me. He explained how ‡ Bird [[‡ Charles Parker]] and the guys were about checking out new things, about how when ‡ Olatunji came around they all jumped into the African thing and they were the first [generation] to take African names. He was saying this also to explain how a lot of cats wanted him to continue playing the stuff that they architected back in the 40s and 50s but ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] was always saying ‘I’m always about checking out that new thing…’ Obviously Miles was able to put that in full effect. ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] had hipped ‡ Miles [[‡ Miles Davis]] to my show “Yo MTV Raps” and he was checking it out. This was an extension of how ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] would always bring me up when the hip-hop thing came up.


Another key thing that ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] said to me after I gave him that demonstration with DJ Spy, ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] said ‘…you know music western music has for a long period of time been a balancing of three different things: melody, harmony and rhythm in equal ways. As black folks have been involved in music we’re added an increasing emphasis on the rhythm element throughout the development of this music.’ And ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]], when he would have a conversation like that would always say ‘from ‡ Louis Armstrong up until…’ He said ‘what you guys are doing is just totally rhythm…’ Now that’s one thing that when he broke it down I said ‘…oh shit, yeah…’ just grabbing different sounds and cutting & scratching, just grabbing a piece of the music and having a way to manually manipulate the record to have this extended rhythm was something ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] heard clearly. He also told me ‘man, if you don’t know it this is so big what you guys are doing…’ I’m like ‘yeah ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]], great…’


It wasn’t until like 10 years later when I’m hosting “Yo MTV Raps”… this was ’92 now, and it was the early 80s when I had this conversation with ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]. By 1988 I’m the host of the first nationally televised show to focus on this rap music and go around the country interviewing the different people who were defining this culture, everybody from ‡ Tupac and ‡ Snoop to ‡ Will Smith and ‡ Run D.M.C., etc., etc. It would all become so much bigger than I ever, ever could have imagined… I’m talking like on a global basis… where people who speak other languages could adopt this thing and make it theirs in a unique way. 


I thought back to what ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] had said and how he was right, and how when we get into it we were just gonna embrace this whole rhythm thing, and how just the verbal, this whole rapping thing was interesting.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: At what point did the light go on and you realized that this was part of a continuum – that what your father and ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] and these guys were into, there was a straight-line continuum to what you and your contemporaries were getting into?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: It was during the time that it blew up. I’m hosting “Yo MTV Raps”, which just came out of nowhere, that was never an intention of mine to be on camera doing things, I always wanted to do things culturally to help stir it up and create these bigger platforms… A lot of my ability and understanding of that were things that I absorbed around my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] and his friends; knowing that ‡ Max Roach and these musicians were loved more so around the world than here… The fact that I knew people who were big in Paris, and Italy, and Japan was just amazing to me, it gave me a sense of the world as a very young kid. 


Hence key things that I would make happen or launch or instigate in hip hop were motivated by those ideas – knowing that, wait a minute, this stuff that we’re doing in the hood, in the Bronx or Brooklyn, is not happening anywhere else in the world. To me that was interesting and I knew it would be at least accepted in other places around the world because these people had embraced and understood the music we were making and put musicians like ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] and them and put them on a pedestal on a par with the greatest European musicians ever and I felt that these people would at least appreciate the things that we were doing, because at that time it was not in any way appreciated by mainstream culture here in America. And that led me to then do things which would become very significant.


The first film on hip hop culture, “Wild Style”, I star in, I do all the music for, I collaborate with a guy named Charlie Ahearn on the film… The initial idea I had was to make a film that showed that there was a link between this music, this rapping and DJ’ing, this break dancing and this graffiti art… there were no links prior. I felt they were all very similar and if we could put it together in a movie in a story that depicted it as such, it would create a much more cohesive cultural picture and a look at what we were doing in the streets and the ghettos of New York. There was no positive press or mentions of a young kid with sneakers on and his had to the side… you were made to look like you were one of those criminals that was destroying the city. So “Wild Style” the movie became this first look that many people around the world had and a spark that ignited them to get busy, and I’m proud of that. Those ideas come directly from the experiences I had being around those kind of individuals [like ‡ Max Roach] and knowing that they made global moves.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: OK, you were sitting around as a young kid doing your thing and these elders were doing their thing, what was it about what you heard or experienced that inspired you?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: I don’t know the specifics, but I just attribute it to… ‡ Jimmy Gittens had a huge influence on a lot of that because he was an artist, he was a sculptor and he started this program called the Sculpture Workshop that was a community organization that you could work as a kid and teach people sculpture in the Bed-Stuy area, and ‡ Jimmy [[‡ Jimmy Gittens]] just loved doing that. So these are my beginning feelings…taking a big chunk of clay and seeing ‡ Jimmy [[‡ Jimmy Gittens]] carve busts of Malcolm, and King Tut, and just making amazing images of us and things, and then me making something and anything I did ‡ Jimmy [[‡ Jimmy Gittens]] and all those guys were just encouraging and enthusiastic about. There was no idea or no kind of thing that was beyond at least discussing in my household. Not so much with my father, but with ‡ Jimmy [[‡ Jimmy Gittens]] and those guys that were kind of an extension of [his dad]. 


It was Jimmy who taught me how to play chess when I was 8 or 9 years old. I felt like their little think tank if you will. They would be talking about big moves the same way I’m sure Obama and his cabinet talk. They were just the most intelligent men… they were very articulate, they were very hip, they were very slick, they were street, all these things and I guess as those things synthesized in me it was just how I thought. It wasn’t always apparent how connected these thoughts were to what I grew up around, but as I grew older I would realize… and I would constantly think of what I was around as a kid and realize what effect these things had on me. Just knowing that ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] was there… 


I can remember when I first began to put two and two together and to figure out what I wanted to be a part of, which was the mainstream pop art world, where there was no real precedent of black folks being key in those spaces… It was really like ‘how do I do this…?’ As I began to make inroads and began to get a little exposure… The first art show that I would have… because that was the main thing, not trying to be a musician, but really became the main thing significant for me… I wanted to be a painter, like the work of Andy Warhol that I had seen as a little kid in a magazine, he looked cool to me… I would find some stuff in art books that made me realize that these guys were inspired by the same stuff that inspired graffiti artists, a lot of us that were painting on the trains… so what’s the difference? I mean we’re getting stuff from comic books and ads just like they did, so what’s the difference? I just had to figure a way to get into the galleries so that people could see me on the same walls they would see like a Warhol or [Roy] Lichtenstein and what not, I wanted to do that the same way that they did.


Through this whole period whenever I would have meetings with ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] I would download all this stuff and he would be so encouraging and enthusiastic. The first show that we had, the first press, was at a real prestigious gallery in Rome in ’79. I’m like 19 or 20… it’s crazy.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Did you and ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] collaborate onstage?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: Yeah, this story I told you about earlier where the guy put us together, that happened at ‡ The Kitchen [NYC]. If you go on YouTube you can find a little clip of it, just a piece of it. I’m like, I’m no musician and Max Roach was one of the biggest figures in my life, he’s a musician, how do I even talk music with him? I’m not a musician, but I could make sounds with my mouth. I was so nervous about giving ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] instructions, like how do you tell this great master musician how and what to play. I remember at one point we had a conversation after we were rehearsing some stuff. He said ‘man listen, I know its kind of difficult for you to be able to tell me what to play, but man don’t even worry about that, you’re in charge.’ It was unbelievable that he would say some shit like that! I’d have to get my shit together and then figure out how to express it to him.


The one regret was… there’s a recording that I’ll dig up, one of the things that we recorded, and I wrote a rap… You see it was hard for me to instruct ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] how to keep like one beat as simply as the backbeat for any one of a million rap records that have been made since then. How do you tell a guy that plays the drums and makes it sound like there are three people playing at once [vocalizes a basic backbeat]… I don’t even know how to do that, it just seemed awkward to say just to do that. What I thought about doing, which we did and I found a recording of that… And this was before sampling was a big thing. I said well what we’ll do is we’ll record and then we’ll loop a recording of what I hear from what you played and I’ll get the engineers to loop that up and make a track of that, and from that track I made a rap over that, which I totally had forgotten that I made this rap: “‡ Max Roach he’s architect, a pioneer, on the drums he’s an architect, an engineer…” I had fly shit that I just wrote up about ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]. When I played it back recently I was like “Oh my God, that’s nice… yeah! But once again it was just unstructured, because the whole song structure [of rap] hadn’t developed and it was just me rapping and ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] playing. I think it had a hook and it would have been very interesting had we released it.


It’s hip hop in the sense that… Hip-hop is more like… I mean people call ‡ Kenny G jazz, but you know and you would have a problem saying that, right?

‡ Willard Jenkins: Yep…

‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Brathwaite, Jr.]]: Good, me too. Along that line we could differentiate between… like ‡ Blondie, something else that I helped make happen, ‡ Deborah Harry making “Rapture”, which was the first rap record to go #1 pop, she’s rapping, but that’s not hip hop. Hip-hop bespeaks many things, particularly being part of the culture, adhering to all those things that are just… you know what I’m saying? Like there’s white cats… not to dismiss ‡ Kenny G because he’s a white boy, but there’s ‡ Gene Krupa, there are a lotta white dudes that you could just feel by how they articulate what they do on their instrument, you’re like OK, dude gets a pass…


I used to love hearing my father and them listening, when I was a young boy… ‘aw man no, that’s so and so, no that’s not him, that sounds like blah, blah, blah… no, that’s an ofay…’ They weren’t dissin’ white people, but it really meant most of the time that they weren’t as up to snuff as most of the official cats. I know that ‡ Gene Krupa got some love and there were some white musicians that my father and them would OK, but not that many… 


What we did you could say it was hip hop, but yeah I was just rappin’, because it’s me because anything I do is officially hip hop because I’m one of the creators of the brand and what not [chuckles].

‡ Willard Jenkins: One of the things that ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] always said about the development of rapping relates to yours being the first generation that was denied the opportunity to pick up any instrument they wanted to learn in school, as a result kids created rap and hip hop.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: Great point, key point, yes ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] would bring that up, instruments are gone from the schools… Its funny I do a lot of work with VH1 and they have this big initiative called “Save the Music” which is a big charitable initiative where they raise all this money to put instruments back in the schools because kids from this generation are not aware for many generations that [the availability of instruments to learn] was a standard thing in schools, almost a requisite. So you’re right, ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]] and them would speak to that. It is in a roundabout way one of the things that gives birth to hip hop, this form, this new thing was because kids were not able to develop and become proficient on instruments like many would have wanted to or would have dabbled in to a certain extent. That would be a discussion we would have with ‡ Max [[‡ Max Roach]]. He was very aware of things going on as they connected to a historical lineage. A lot of this shit didn’t click then, but I’m glad I remembered it because it all fit into place as they years went by.

‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ Jimmy Morton told us that you have a lot of photographs from back in the day when your father and his friends were active in Brooklyn jazz.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: He gave me the actual slides of his color transparencies, and from those I’ve made a few prints; none have been published except for what’s in ‡ Robin [[‡ Robin Kelley]]’s book [Thelonious Monk bio].

‡ Willard Jenkins: What memorabilia do you have from your dad?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: I’ve got a lot of his books and stuff, not a lot of stuff. Unfortunately we were not great memorabilia keepers, but I’ve got some things. I actually got to visit Shanghai, China last year and I often tell people to sum it up that Mao was like Jesus Christ in my house, the symbol of him, what he would later mean for a lot of people looking for alternatives… When I went to the big tourist souvenir places where they make everything look old… there was a period after Mao’s demise after the Gang of Four. It was ironic after going to China and seeing that China was able to adapt capitalism while still remaining a communist country, a buddy of mine gave me a BBC documentary and I was able to see the whole story, so it almost took it back to where my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] was still following it. To be there and be able to buy some of the red books and some of the posters that my dad [[‡ Fred Braithwaite]] and them had all those years ago, thirty years later, was just incredible for me, it was like coming full circle.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Is there any chance of getting a look at those photos?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Fab Five Freddy [[‡ Fred Braithwaite, Jr.]]: Sure, there is only a small grouping of photos, I’ll show them to you, I didn’t know you guys wanted to see them. There are only about twenty and I’m just glad over all those years they still survive. I always thought of something along the lines of what you guys are doing, to kind of tell this story for cats in Brooklyn that most people don’t know about. My dad and his friends were very Brooklyn-centric. It was a campaign about how bad Brooklyn was. 


When I was coming up, living in Brooklyn and coming into the city doing the shit that I did was literally no different, except for the living space and miles of course, than going to California, Manhattan was literally that far away. When you grow up 100% Brooklyn, you might make a couple of forays into the city, or New York – which is how people would call [Manhattan] back then – to see a movie, go to Times Square, or to the Village, was like literally a big deal, that’s how it was when I was growing up.


When I branched off and ventured into the city and connected with the Blondies and the punk rockers and began to set my shit on fire I was one of the few people on the scene who were literally New Yorkers. Most of the people on the downtown scene were from everywhere, like on the art scene, they would come to New York to make it. Me and ‡ Jean Michel Basquiat were the only two people that were New Yorkers, which was really cool. When you really know the history Brooklyn was at one time quite a prominent, full on city – a much bigger landmass than the rest of the city. Fulton Street used to mirror 125th Street [in Manhattan]. There a lot of clubs on Fulton Street, which was like our 125th Street; we had the ‡ Baby Grand [‡ Baby Grand Brooklyn], the ‡ Blue Coronet…

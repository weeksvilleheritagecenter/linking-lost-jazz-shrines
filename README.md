# Linking Lost Jazz Shrines

## About the Repository<br>
This repository holds the documentation and data for [Weeksville Heritage Center's](https://www.weeksvillesociety.org/) "Linking Lost Jazz Shrines" project, supported through the [Collections as Data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/) initiative, which is supported by the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/mellon/). The Linking Lost Jazz Shrines project is a collaboration between Weeksville Heritage Center and the [Semantic Lab at Pratt](https://semlab.io/).

## About the Project<br>
The Linking Jazz Shrines Project seeks to apply linked open data principles to the Weeksville Heritage Center's Lost Jazz Shrines of Brooklyn Oral history collection. This collection was part of a 2008 research project documenting Central Brooklyn’s cultural legacy of jazz history between the 1930s and 1960s. Through the application linked open data methodologies, we plan to make these collections and the connections they provide more discoverable to jazz researchers that would benefit from a significant collection about Central Brooklyn’s nearly lost jazz culture.

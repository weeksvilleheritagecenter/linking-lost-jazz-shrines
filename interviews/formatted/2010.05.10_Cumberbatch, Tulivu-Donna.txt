‡ Willard Jenkins: You are a vocalist and a vocal educator? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Yes I am, as ‡ Nancy Wilson said I'm a vocal stylist and an educator as well. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Please tell us about your father ‡ Harold Cumberbatch's career and his work here in ‡ Brooklyn. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: ‡ My father [[Harold Cumberbatch]] started out as an alto saxophonist. He was born in Harlem but his family moved here to ‡ Brooklyn when he was very young, so he grew up here in Brownsville, in ‡ Brooklyn. He went to Metropolitan High School where he said he had a very intense music program; music from morning until afternoon, all day. ‡ Coleman Hawkins  was one of his classmates, and he mentioned quite a few musicians that I can't name now, but it was a very intense program. He started out on viola then he went to alto saxophone. He freelanced with a lot of different groups, ‡ Lionel Hampton, he did a stint in the ‡ Count Basie band for awhile, with ‡ Arnett Cobb, and numerous other musicians. ‡ Arnett Cobb is the one who inspired her father to switch from the alto saxophone to the baritone saxophone, so the baritone became his love. He and ‡ Cecil Payne used to have baritone battles on the saxophone. 


He grew up with ‡ Randy Weston, ‡ Wynton Kelly, ‡ Ernie Henry... ‡ Max Roach, those were his running 
partners, they all grew up in this area – Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant... they played all the little clubs around here. He played in other states as well but I don't think he ever did a European tour, but he just traveled around the U.S., and of course all the different clubs in New York. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: I've been working with ‡ Randy Weston on his book, which is coming out in October, and he mentioned your father's name frequently as far as those musicians of pretty much the same age that used to go to  Max Roach's house and work different things out, and all the greats — people like ‡  Dizzy Gillespie, ‡ Charlie Parker, ‡ Miles Davis, etc. used to be at Max's house because ‡ Max [[Max Roach]] knew everybody. During this research project one of our aims is to talk about the places these musicians played and hung out in ‡ Brooklyn. What particular joints here in ‡ Brooklyn did your father talk about playing? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: I remember him talking about ‡ Putnam Central, the ‡ Blue Coronet, the ‡ Sonia Ballroom... I can't remember the names but I used to work in the ‡ Ray Abrams Big Band and that's the first band that both of us played in together. ‡ Ray [[Ray Abrams]] used to point out to me, practically on every corner there was a jazz club here in ‡ Brooklyn; I don't remember the names of them but he used to point them out to me as we were driving in the car. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Did your father do any recording?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: A little bit, not much that I’m aware of, I do have a recording of him when he had his own bandat the ‡ West End Cafe in Manhattan; Phil Schaap sent a copy to me, [her father] had a band called ‡ Swing to Bop Quintet. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: When did your father pass and was he playing actively up until his passing? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: No, he had gotten ill in the late 80s and he spent his last few years living in Mt. Vernon with his brother. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Was your father a big man? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: No he wasn't, people used to tease him and say the hom [bari sax] was bigger than he was [laughs]. He was short in stature, not very husky, just medium build. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Did he come from a large family and were there other musicians in the family? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Not that I know of, I don't know any of the family past my grandparents. He had three brothers and none of them were musicians, they just loved the music. Going back past my grandparents I don't know [if there were other musicians in the family].


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What do you know of other influences on his musical development as far as growing up in the neighborhood he grew up in? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: I know he loved singers and there were three musicians that influenced him the most: ‡ Charlie Parker, ‡ Lester Young and ‡ Louis Armstrong; those were his three favorite musicians. In fact I was named after one of Charlie Parker's tunes that he made famous. "Donna Lee." Those were his absolute favorite three musicians, and he loved singers so he loved ‡ Nat King Cole, ‡ Frank Sinatra, ‡ Sarah Vaughan, ‡ Ella Fitzgerald, and ‡ Carmen McRae. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: The fact that these singers were such great favorites of his, as a child how did he introduce the music to you and how did it become your obsession? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: It wasn't only him, it was he and my mother both. My mother wanted to be a professional singer but at that time my grandparents would not allow it. But she had a beautiful voice and she would sing in the house all the time and ‡ Billie Holiday was her favorite. So I learned all the ‡ Billie Holiday songs by the time I was three years old. Both of them... I listened to the music they had in the house, I listened to him practicing all the time, and then my mother singing to me all the time, so I just knew from the time I was 3 I wanted to sing. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: At what point did you begin to take lessons? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: In elementary school I started taking piano lessons. I went to a Catholic school about three blocks from here [in Bed-Stuy] and the nuns used to give piano lessons, so my grandmother signed me up and made me practice, which I didn't like then but am appreciative of now, so that started it. I always sang in my church as well, all the children had to participate in any programs in church, so I sang in elementary and high school as well. They had excellent music programs, in elementary school we did full-fledged Broadway shows, with costumes…  This was at Our Lady of Victory on Throop. We had excellent choir directors, in high school we had four choruses; we also had the boys glee club and the girls cantata. This was at Our Lady of Victory [elementary school] and Erasmus Hall [high school], which had an excellent music program, one of the best in the city. Also in high school I participated in the ‡ All-City Chorus, with Mr. John Motley, which was a fabulous experience because Mr. Motley was one of the premier vocal coaches in the country.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Besides Mr. Motley what other teachers had an impact on you? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: The outstanding choir directors I had, my piano teachers —  after taking piano lessons at Our Lady of Victory my grandmother hired a piano teacher, Mr. Barrett, who came to our house to teach, 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So your parents and your grandmother actively encouraged your learning music? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Yes, they did. My grandmother definitely kept after me to practice the piano everyday, even though she had discouraged my mother, she did support and encourage me — it was a different era. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: At what point did you determine that music would be — if not your profession, at least part of your professional life? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Probably when I got to college. I minored in music — I should have majored in music — at Hunter College, which after my first year they changed to Herbert H. Lehman College. In my first year of different college venues, for weddings, and in nightclubs. But I didn't expect to participate full time in music, but music was always my first love and I just should have gone full fledged into it. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What does your regret stem from as far as minoring in music instead of majoring in music? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: It steins from just a lack of confidence in being able to support myself as a musician, 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What do you regret as far as what majoring in music might have given you as opposed to minoring in music? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: I guess I would have been totally involved in the music business at an earlier age. Instead of veering off and going into sociology and then education and going to teach for the board of education and singing on the weekends, part-time. I lasted at the board of ed about ten years and I said 'this is not it... So I left the board of ed and then I decided to do the music full-time. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Before you decided to sing full-time you were doing it part-time? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Yes. During the week and on weekends I would do colleges, nightclubs, weddings, dances, things like that, mostly in ‡ Brooklyn and in the Tri-State area, 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What kinds of places were you playing in ‡ Brooklyn? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: We did ‡ The East in ‡ Brooklyn, which was a jazz mecca at the time, dances, people would call us -- different colleges would call us for black history programs, sometimes museums… 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Were there any other clubs you played in ‡ Brooklyn? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Yes, but I can't remember all of the names.


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: How would you compare the experience of playing at ‡ The East with other places? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: ‡ The East was by far the most enjoyable place to play. Like I said it was a jazz mecca and people from all over the city would come to ‡ The East on a Saturday night. You had everybody from ‡ Rahsaan Roland Kirk to ‡ McCoy Tyner, ‡ Jean Cam... you name it, they played there. One time I was on a bill with ‡ McCoy Tyner and I said to him 'its an honor to share the stage with you' and he said, 'listen, it's an honor for me to share the stage with you." Everybody played at ‡ The East and it was just a wholesome, uplifting, spiritual atmosphere. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What made it so? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: The people were very much into Afrocentrism, the politics, they were demonstrating... the food was wholesome, delicious and nutritious... All of those kinds of things, that kind of atmosphere. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Any conversation about ‡ The East has to touch on what for some was quite controversial, the fact that it was strictly for black folks. Were you aware of that? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: I had totally forgotten about that, I was so into the music and who was playing there. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: When you were performing at ‡ The East, what was the audience like and did that differ from what you experienced in other places? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: I guess they were more enthusiastic, more encouraging, always had something positive to say about the performances and how much they enjoyed it. Definitely the Amen Corner was there, hollering and shouting like you were in church. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What kind of group did you have when you performed at ‡ The East? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: I had my own group, in fact the bass player I worked with there I still work with now, ‡ Rashim, and various people who would be available at the time. Sometimes I accompanied myself on piano. I remember the first East street festival I worked with ‡ Onaje Allan Gumbs and ‡ Buddy Williams was on drums. The personnel changed but ‡ Rashim was always there. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: That 40 year + relationship with your bass player reminds me of ‡ Billie Holiday saying the bass player was always the most important member of her band. Is that true with you? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: For me its the drums, if the drummer is not right it throws everything off because that's the foundation of our music, whether its reggae, calypso, samba, r&b or whatever, if the drummer is not happening, it ain't happenin' But jazz is a democracy and everybody is important, everybody has something important to say, no one is really more important than the other. Jazz is the greatest form of democracy that there is. All the instruments are important. I especially love working with a trio because of the intimacy, we feed off of each other, we inspire each other...  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: And you've found the piano-bass-drums trio to be best for you. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: The best for me... I love working with a big band or an orchestra, especially the string section, but the trio is that intimate setting that I love most of all. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Let's say you were working with a small ensemble with horns, what adjustments do you have to make then?  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: The only adjustment is just to find a good arrangement that will work. I love horns too, saxophone is really my favorite instrument, my father's instrument. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: When did you and your father have opportunities to work together? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: The first time was with the ‡ Ray Abrams Big Band. He and his friends also formed a band called the ‡ Baritone Saxophones, which was six baritone saxophones and a rhythm section and I worked with them, I still work with that group.  


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: How is it singing in the midst of all those baritones? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: [Laughs], its fun, I enjoy it, especially if you have good arrangements. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Do you find opportunities to work a lot in ‡ Brooklyn these days? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Not a lot, not only not in ‡ Brooklyn but period. First of all the venues are not as plentiful as they used to be, Its feast or famine; one month you could be very busy, next month not. I was busy all spring, but not this summer. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Have you found much of your work to be in ‡ Brooklyn? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Yes, but as most jazz musicians I've been very blessed to have been able to travel, not only in the United States but also in different parts of the world; that's one of the perks of being in the business, even though jazz musicians are not that financially successful all the time, they do get to travel, to see a lot of the world. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: When you were coming up and learning your craft, did you frequent jazz places in ‡ Brooklyn and if so which ones?


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Oh yes, definitely. To tell you the truth not too many in ‡ Brooklyn because by the time I started going out a lot of those places that ‡ Ray Abrams had pointed out to me had gone so I found myself going out to Manhattan mostly. I caught a little bit at the ‡ Blue Coronet, but then that vanished too. ‡ Kingston Lounge on Kingston and Lincoln Place, that one I went to. The one in Fort Greene on Lafayette Avenue — its an Italian restaurant now — that one I went to, its ‡ [Scopello's] [sp?] now, that was another one. Of course ‡ The East... Later on came ‡ Sista's Place, ‡ The Flamingo [[The Flamingo Lounge]]... but mostly I would travel to Manhattan. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So have you played ‡ Sista's Place? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Oh yes, many times... They call me at least 2-3 times a year. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What is the scene like at ‡ Sista's Place and how would you compare that to some of the previous generation of jazz clubs? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Actually ‡ Sista's Place reminds me of ‡ The East, just on a smaller scale. It has that same kind of vibe, the Amen Corner. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Have you had much opportunity to record? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: Yes, I've produced three of my own recordings with ‡ Andre Strobert [sp?], my dear brother that passed, on his label ‡ Kiki Records and then I've recorded on other people's recordings as well: with the ‡ Baritone Saxophones, another group I'm in called the ‡ Brooklyn Repertory Ensemble with ‡ Wade Barnes, a couple of Japanese producers I've worked on their records — with ‡ Yoko Kanno... various other people who call on me to do songs on their recordings. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What is your overall assessment of the history of jazz in ‡ Brooklyn during your lifetime? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Tulivu-Donna Cumberbatch: So many people have come out of ‡ Brooklyn, and many musicians who were not even born in ‡ Brooklyn at one time resided in ‡ Brooklyn, lived in ‡ Brooklyn at least when they initially came to New York — like the mecca; people like ‡ Wynton Kelly and ‡  Max Roach who were the cornerstones of ‡ Brooklyn jazz. In fact ‡ my father and mother grew up with ‡ Wynton Kelly and he has influenced so many piano players, practically every piano player I talk to say they were influenced in some way by ‡ Wynton Kelly. Of course there are also the people who are right out of ‡ Brooklyn, like ‡ Randy Weston, ‡ Ernie Henry... the list is endless. And ‡ Brooklyn has its own very unique sound, you gotta hear it, its not describable but if you hear it you know it [laughs]. Its a very soulful, gritty, slick sound... There definitely is a ‡ Brooklyn sound. Listen to ‡ Rafik Williamson [sp?] or ‡ Ed Stoute or any of those cats... Randy Weston... its definitely a very unique sound. So many jazz musicians even now reside in ‡ Brooklyn, instrumentalists and vocalists.

‡ Willard Jenkins: You are part of the December 12th movement? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: Yes, I chair the December 12th movement. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Why is it known as the December 12th movement? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: Some years ago there was an incident in upstate New York where the guards in the Orange County Jail house put on Ku Klux Klan outfits and abused two African American and one Latino prisoner. At that time three of our brothers were on trial in Goshen for weapon's possession and we had a judge that was from hell. So when we went to court for our three brothers, the mother of one of the victims in the county jail heard us take on the judge. After that she said to us "you know, these young men were brutalized, etc. and nothing has happened — this was Newburg, New York in 87 — and we need some of your spirit up here. So we began to talk to her about how we take on the county jail apparatus in Orange County. We had a subsequent date for our three brothers [who were on trial] and when we went back we met with this woman Lilly Howard. 


She said that in addition to that [county jail incident], this young woman by the name of Tawana Brawley has been assaulted and raped, alleged by either the Klan or just white rednecks in Goshen, and we should do something about it.

‡ Willard Jenkins: So your movement started around those two incidents? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: Yes, in 1987.

‡ Willard Jenkins: Are you a native of ‡ Brooklyn? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: No. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: How long have you been in ‡ Brooklyn? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: I've always lived in Queens — I was born and raised in southeast Queens, I worked in ‡ Brooklyn from the Oceanhill-Brownsville [school crisis]. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: So you're a teacher by trade? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: Yes, I was. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: ‡ Roger Wareham gave us a lot of background on your activities. From a jazz perspective what are some of your memories of jazz in ‡ Brooklyn? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: Definitely ‡ The East, which is where we celebrated our musicians; that was the first place I saw  ‡ Gary Bartz...  ‡ The Blue Coronet... my husband was a jazz fan, that was his music. What I remember about a particular piano player is that he was as high as he wanted to be he had a real contradiction with  ‡ Thelonious Monk [can't remember his name]. The first time I heard him was at the Blue Coronet…  


I'm a black woman. I celebrate black culture, I celebrate black music, I celebrate just the innate humanity of black people, so that's what the music was then. It was definitely jazz, but it was the music of the community, a music of the street. We used to go over to the ‡ Baby Grand [[Baby Grand  Brooklyn]]... ‡ Brooklyn more so than Manhattan, for me was much more community; it wasn't so hip, like we used to go to ‡ Slug's, ‡ Baby Grand [[Baby Grand Harlem]] uptown [Harlem] ... But ‡ Brooklyn was more black people, that's how I saw it. Harlem was hip, but ‡ Brooklyn was more people-oriented. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Talk about the December 12th movement in terms of arts & culture. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: One of the things is that we because of our politics — understood that culture was the transmission belt of struggle, of understanding who you are, what the value of it was. Our advent into needing to have somewhere musicians could play is that we had a series in Harlem called "Jazz Comes to Fight Back”, and the first person we had — it was at the old Music & Art High School — was ‡ Wynton Marsalis, when he first came out. Because we understood that jazz expressed who we were, and talked about our humanity and our values; it was in the music, it was in the rhythms, it was in the melody and the riffs. For December 12th it was the way in which we could say to the people that struggle is for liberation and that there is no struggle for struggle's sake, but that it is a part of every aspect of our life. Art is not art for art's sake, art is that expression, and the music… ‡ Sister Thulani always says, and it's so true, that music saved our lives. From the blues to the gospel, to jazz, to r&b… it really saved our lives. And for the December 12th movement people heard our politics better [as a result of the music]. From Africa, to ‡ Brooklyn, to Harlem, to Goshen... it was always the music, it was always the dance... in my other life I was a dancer. 


I was introduced to the Harlem chorus girls a million years ago. We're clear that it is culture that will determine whether or not you respect and continue to build your humanity and your people... that's the determining factor. ‡ Alvin Ailey, ‡ Curtis Mayfield, ‡ Trane [[John Coltrane]], ‡ Miles [[Miles Davis]]... I love to tell that story about this guy who said to ‡ Miles [[Miles Davis]] if you had your *druthers, what would you rather do?' And ‡ Miles [[Miles Davis]] said "I'd choke a white boy to death... [laughs]. So that's how we see our struggle, our culture. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Why is this place known specifically as ‡ Sista's Place? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: We were sitting around the table talking about how it was that we were going to name this establishment. We said that we were going to name this institution Knutsa [sp?] House, because Knutsa meant the gathering of the family. So this brother that worked with us said, 'look, in Bed-Stuy in 1994 that may be really good for those of us who know Swahili and know these different African languages and stuff, that may be alright for US, but if we want to draw in other people we need a simpler name. He said you all are gonna do this, right?' He said 'then call it ‡ Sista's Place, but you gotta spell it Sista's. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What was the decision behind determining that this place was going to have a real strong jazz presence? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: We thought that in this community, after ‡ The East was gone, after all the music places were gone... and remember, we had started that in Harlem... "Jazz Comes to Fight Back", because we feel that it is jazz that really expresses, at least for us old people, our culture; it's the music that grew out of struggle, that got interpreted, and that some of the brothers and sisters [jazz musicians] that are still alive didn't play in our community, because there was no places to play when we started. I said the music I like best is jazz, so they called me the jazz policeman; I thought that was the music that was needed in our community. 


When we were in the former location down the street, there was a brother who worked for the railroad who had three boys and he would bring them every night. Then there was another lady who has passed away, her nephew would come and they would be awestruck at how these brothers had conquered their instruments, and they would listen... they HEARD the music. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: How is the audience at ‡ Sista's Place different from the audiences at other places you've been? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: People come to hear the music, they experience the music, they understand what the music is saying, they celebrate the musicians... Other places I've been people pay their money and sit and talk and clink glasses and that kinda stuff... One night we had a fantastic band and there was a Chinese man who was visiting. I went up on the stage and he looked, I said CLAP... you didn't like the music? So then everybody stood up and applauded. People really get into your being; say the sisters who are showing people to their seats, its like 'we want to share this [music] with you. It's something that is of great value to [the audience]. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: What's the reaction from musicians who play here? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: Everyone says this is it, this is one of the best places they've ever played. Because #1 they get paid, #2 they appreciate that the people listen to their music and that we treat them like they're artists, and like they're contributing to our struggle, and then the way the audience responds to them. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Willard Jenkins: Given the fact that you're part of a movement and that you've traveled and interacted with people in other communities, has there ever been anyone who has come here and said we need to do this at home? Or have you ever encouraged or assisted people in other communities to do this kind of thing? 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Viola Plummer: Yes, and there's a brother we worked with named ‡ Ron Washington — who passed on Saturday — Who duplicated this at ‡ Cecil's [West Orange, NJ]... And the musicians that played here would play there Friday and play here Saturday. When he came here he was like I've gotta do this...' And he did it Friday nights at ‡ Cecil's. 


I think ‡ Sista's Place is wonderful, it has had the benefit of the history of ‡ The East; it has had the benefit of the coming together of jazz and poetry, and history... I think what ‡ Sista's Place enabled us to do — the comrades that I worked with it enabled us to meet people that they only read about. We do this thing for ‡ Trane [[John Coltrane]] and people are so engrossed with the genius, and we did this thing for ‡ Miles [[Miles Davis]], and now my grandchildren can now talk to me about some real music, Nobody gets paid here... We do it for the music; if we could just keep pushing this kind of network, it would be our path towards  freedom. 


~BLOCKBREAK~


‡ Roger Wareham interjects: Like I said, nobody gets paid at ‡ Sista's Place, we're all volunteers, we're part of an organization that is for the liberation of our people. But a key element is the leadership that is provided by ‡ Viola [[Viola Plummer]]; it's really important in terms of the history that she brings to it and she helps us to continue doing this.
